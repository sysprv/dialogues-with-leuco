  ◊p[#:class "intro"]{
Had it been possible, I would gladly have done without all
this mythology. But myth, it seems to me, is a language of
its own, an instrument of expression. There is nothing arbitrary
about it. It is a seedbed of symbolic forms, possessing, like
all languages, its own rage of meanings which can be
conveyed in no other way. When we retell an old myth—a
proper name, an action, a heroic feat—we are expressing, with
the utmost economy of means, a general and comprehensive
fact, a core of reality which quickens and feeds a whole
organic growth of passion and human existence, an entire
conceptual complex. If this mythical name or action also
happens to be familiar to us from childhood, from our
schooldays, so much the better. What is more acutely
disturbing than to see familiar stories troubled into new life?
In these dialogues I have confined myself to Greek
mythology. For obvious reasons these myths have never lost
their popularity; they can count on both an immediate and a
traditional acceptance. At all costs I wanted to avoid
whatever is shapeless, irregular, accidental; even in subject
matter, I wanted to confine myself within a given frame; I
have tried for a concrete, finite presence. A true revelation,
I am convinced, can only emerge from stubborn concentration
on a single problem. I have nothing in common with
experimentalists, adventurers, with those who travel in strange
regions. The surest, and the quickest, way for us to arouse the
sense of wonder is to stare, unafraid, at a single object.
Suddenly—miraculously—it will look like something we have
never seen before.

  ◊dialogue-intro-title{THE CLOUD}
  ◊dialogue-intro{
It seems likely that Ixion was condemned to Tartarus
because of his presumptions. But that he fathered the
Centaurs on the clouds is false, since the race of Centaurs
already existed at the time of his son's marriage.
The Lapiths and the Centaurs belong to the age
of the Titans, when very different creatures
were still permitted to mate and interbreed. The
result was that swarm of monsters which Olympus
later pursued with implacable hatred.

  ◊dialogue-title{The Cloud, Ixion}

  ◊cloud{Ixion, there is a law and we must obey it.}
  ◊ixion{
The law has no power here, Nephele. Here the law is the
glacier, the storm, the darkness. And when at last the
weather clears and you drift softly toward the peak, it's no
time then to be thinking about the law.
  }
  ◊cloud{
There is a law, Ixion, which didn't exist before. A
stronger hand now masses the clouds.
  }
  ◊ixion{
That hand doesn't reach here. Look, the weather's clear,
and you're laughing, aren't you? And when the sky turns
black and the wind howls, who cares about the hand that
scatters us like rain? That was what happened in the days
when there was no master. Nothing has changed up here on
the mountains. We're used to all this.
  }
  ◊cloud{
Much has changed on the mountains. Pelion knows
it. Ossa and Olympus know it. Wilder mountains know it
too.
  }
  ◊ixion{What has changed on the mountains, Nephele?}
  ◊cloud{
Not the sun, not the rain, Ixion. Man's fate has
changed. There are monsters. A limit has been imposed
upon you mortals. The rain, the wind, the peak, and the
clouds are no longer yours to possess. You can no longer
hold them in your arms, live with them. Other hands now
hold the world. There is a law, Ixion.
  }
  ◊ixion{What law?}
  ◊cloud{You already know. Your fate, the limit imposed
upon you—
  }
◊; page-number 3
  ◊ixion{
I hold my fate in my fist, Nephele. What has changed?
Can these new masters stop me from throwing boulders
for the joy of it? Or from going down to the plain and
breaking an enemy's back? Are they any more terrible than
fatigue and death?
  }
  ◊cloud{
That's not it, Ixion. You can still do all that, and
more besides. But you can no longer mate with us, the
nymphs of the wind, the goddesses of the earth. Destiny has
changed.
  }
  ◊ixion{No longer? What do you mean, Nephele?}
  ◊cloud{
I mean that if you try to do what you once did, you'll
do something terrible. Like a man who tries to embrace a
friend and strangle him, or is strangled himself.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I don't understand. You mean you're leaving the mountain?
You're afraid of me?
  }
  ◊cloud{
I'll be here on the mountain, here and everywhere.
But I'm out of your reach, Ixion. You're powerless against
the rain and the wind. You must bow your head. That's
your only salvation.
  }
  ◊ixion{You're afraid, Nephele.}
  ◊cloud{
Yes, I'm afraid. I've seen the mountain peaks. But
I'm not afraid for myself, Ixion. I cannot suffer. I'm afraid
for you—you who are only men. These mountains where
you were once the masters, where you used to run, and
these creatures, our children, conceived when we were both
free, now tremble at a nod. We are all the slaves of a
stronger hand. The Centaurs, sons of the wind and the
rain, are hiding in the deep ravines. They know they are
monsters.
  }
  ◊ixion{Who says so?}
  ◊cloud{
Don't defy that hand, Ixion. It is fate. I've seen
others, more reckless than you or the Centaurs, hurl themselves
from the cliff and not die. Understand me, Ixion.
◊; page-number 4
Death, in which your courage was defined, can be taken
from you, like a blessing refused. Do you know this?
  }
  ◊ixion{
You've told me so before. What does it matter? We'll
live more intensely.
  }
  ◊cloud{You can't be serious. You don't know the immortals.}
  ◊ixion{I want to know them, Nephele.}
  ◊cloud{
Ixion, you think they're presences like us, like Night,
Earth, or old Pan. You're young, Ixion, but you were born
under the old dispensation. For you there are no monsters,
there are only friends. For you death is something that
happens, like day, like night. You're one of us, Ixion. What
you are is what you do, and that is all. But for them, the
immortals, everything you do has a meaning that lingers.
And they probe everything from far off, with their eyes,
their nostrils, their lips. They are immortal and they cannot
live for themselves alone. What you achieve or don't
achieve, what you say, what you search for—all these things
gladden or displease them. And if you offend them—if you
make the mistake of disturbing them on their Olympus
—they swoop down upon you, bringing death—the death
which they know, a bitterness which lasts, which is felt
forever.
  }
  ◊ixion{We can still die.}
  ◊cloud{
No, Ixion. They will turn you into a kind of shadow,
a shade that wants to live but never dies.
  }
  ◊ixion{Have you seen them, these gods of yours?}
  ◊cloud{
I have seen them . . . Oh Ixion, you don't know
what you're asking.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I've seen some of them too, Nephele. I don't find them
so terrible.
  }
  ◊cloud{
I knew it. Your fate is sealed. Which one did you
see?
  }
  ◊ixion{
How could I tell? It was a young man. He was walking
barefoot through the forest. He passed by me, but didn't
◊; page-number 5
speak. Then he vanished before a cliff. For a long time
I stood there looking for him, too amazed to move. I wanted
to ask him who he was. He seemed to be a creature of flesh,
like you.
  }
  ◊cloud{Is he the only one you saw?}
  ◊ixion{
I saw him again in a dream, with the goddesses. I seemed
to be standing beside them, talking and laughing with them.
And they were telling me the same things that you're saying,
but without fear, without trembling like you. We talked
together of fate and death. We talked about Olympus. We
laughed at the ridiculous monsters—
  }
  ◊cloud{
O Ixion, Ixion, your fate is sealed! Now you know
what has changed up there above the mountains. And
you've changed too. And you think you're more than a man.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I tell you, Nephele, that you're like them. Why shouldn't
I admire them, at least in a dream?
  }
  ◊cloud{
Fool, you can't stop at dreams. You'll climb up to
them, aspire to them. You'll do something terrible. Then
that death of theirs will come.
  }
  ◊ixion{Tell me all the goddesses' names.}
  ◊cloud{
You see? Dreaming isn't enough for you now.
You believe in your dream as if it were real. I implore you,
Ixion, don't climb to the top. Think of the monsters and
how they were punished. The same thing will happen to
you.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I had another dream last night. You were in it too,
Nephele. We were fighting the Centaurs. I had a son whose
mother was one of the goddesses—I don't know which. And
he looked like that same young god who was walking
through the forest. He was stronger than me, Nephele. The
Centaurs ran away, and the mountain was ours. You were
laughing, Nephele. You see, even in my dreams, I can
accept my fate.
  }
◊; page-number 6
  ◊cloud{
Your fate is sealed. No one lifts his eyes to a goddess
with impunity.
  }
  ◊ixion{
Not even to the Goddess of the Oaks, the Lady of the
Peaks?
  }
  ◊cloud{
It doesn't matter which, Ixion. But don't be afraid.
I'll be with you till the end.

  ◊dialogue-intro-title{THE CHIMERA}
  ◊dialogue-intro{
It was with high hearts that the youth of Greece set out
for the East in quest of glory and death. Here their
courage and daring took them through a sea of fabulous
atrocities, in which some of them failed to keep their
heads. There is no point in citing names. Besides, there
were more than seven such Crusades. It is Homer
himself who—in Book VI of the ◊roman{Iliad}—tells us of the
melancholy which consumed the killer of the Chimera
in his old age, and of his young grandson Sarpedon
who died under the walls of Troy.

  ◊dialogue-title{Hippolochus, Sarpedon}

  ◊hippolochus{Ah, there you are, boy.}
  ◊sarpedon{
Hippolochus, I found your father. He won't hear of
coming home. You should see him. He's a terrible sight—
plodding through the countryside, covered with filth, oblivious
of the weather. He's an old beggar, Hippolochus.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What do the peasants say about him?}
  ◊sarpedon{
The Aleian plain is deserted, a wilderness, Uncle.
Reeds and swampland, nothing else. I asked about him in
the valley of the Xanthus, but they hadn't seen him for days.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What about him? What does he say?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He has no memory of home or us. Whenever he meets
somebody, he talks to him about the Solymi, of Glaucus,
Sisyphus, and the Chimera. When he saw me, he said, "if
I were your age, boy, I'd go drown myself." He doesn't
threaten the living. "Boy," he said to me, "you're just,
you're merciful. We're just and merciful men. If you want
to stay just and merciful, stop living."
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
Bellerophon bitter? Bellerophon grumbling? I can't
believe it.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
You should hear the terrible threats he makes. He
dares the gods to accept his challenge. Night and day he
keeps on walking. All his rancor, all his bitterness, is lavished
on the dead—or rather on the gods.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Glaucus and Sisyphus, you mean?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He says they were punished by treachery. Why wait
until they're old and feeble before ambushing them? "Bellerophon,"
◊; page-number 9
he says, "was just and merciful as long as the
blood coursed in his body. And now that he's old and
alone, why do the gods decide to abandon him?"
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
It's strange that should surprise him. And that he
should blame the gods for something which every living
thing must suffer. But he was always just. What do he and
those dead men have in common?
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
Listen, Hippolochus. When I saw those desperate
eyes of his, I too wondered if this was really Bellerophon
I was talking to. Something has happened to your father.
Not just old age. Not just misery and loneliness. Your
father is atoning for the death of the Chimera.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Are you mad, Sarpedon?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Your father accuses the gods of injustice because they
wanted him to kill the Chimera. Over and over again he
says, "From the day I stained myself with the monster's
blood, I haven't had a real life. I have looked for men to
fight, tamed the Amazons, slaughtered the Solymi. I ruled
over Lycia and I planted a great garden—but all this was
nothing. Where can I find another Chimera? Where is the
strength of the arms that killed her? Sisyphus and my
father Glaucus were just men, young men—then as they
grew old, the gods abandoned them both, let them become
wild animals and die. How can the man who met the
Chimera resign himself to death?" That's how your father
talks. The man who used to be Bellerophon.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
From Sisyphus, who chained the infant Thanatos,
to Glaucus who fed living men to his mares, our breed
has broken its bounds. But these are men of the past; they
belonged to an age of monsters. The Chimera was the last
monster they knew. Our land is just and merciful now.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
Are you sure, Hippolochus? You think that killing
the Chimera was enough? Our father—I can call him that
—should know. And yet he's as gloomy as a god—some
◊; page-number 10
white-haired old tramp of a god—and he roams through
fields and swamps talking to his dead.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What is he looking for?}
  ◊sarpedon{
The arm that killed the Chimera. He wants the pride
of Glaucus and Sisyphus, especially now that he, like them,
has reached the boundary of things, the limit, the end.
Their courage torments him. He knows a second Chimera
will never lie in wait for him among the rocks. And he
defies the gods.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
Sarpedon, I'm his son, but these are things I can't
understand. The earth is just a place now—why can't men
grow old in piece? In a young man, almost a boy like you,
Sarpedon, I can understand the tumult of the blood. But
only in a young man. Only for a just cause. Not revolt
against the gods.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
But he knows what it's like to be young, he knows
what old age is like. He's seen other days. He has looked
at the gods, as you and I look at each other now. He tells
of terrible things.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Why listen then?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Oh Hippolochus, who could help listening? Bellerophon
has seen things which don't often happen.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
I know, Sarpedon, I know. But that world is over.
When I was a child, he told me the same stories.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
But there's a difference—he wasn't talking with the
dead in those days. They were only stories then. But now
every destiny he meets becomes his own.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What did he tell you?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Things you already know. But what you can't know
is the coldness, the desperation in his eye, like the look of
a man who is no longer anything but who knows everything.
Stories of Lydia and Phrygia, old stories, without
justice, without mercy. You know the story of Silenus?
How a god challenged him to a contest on Mt. Celaenae,
◊; page-number 11
and then killed him by cutting him to pieces, like a butcher
slicing up a goat? And now a spring—of his own blood,
they say—wells up from the cave. Or the story of the mother
who was turned to stone, touched to weeping rock, because
it pleased a goddess to kill her children with arrows, one
by one? And the story of Arachne, who shuddered with
terror at Athena's hatred and became a spider? These are
things that happened. The gods did them.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
And the gods were right to do them. What do
they matter? There's no point in thinking of those things.
Of those destinies, nothing now remains.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
The spring remains, the mountain, the terror. The
dreams remain. Bellerophon can't take a step without stumbling
on a corpse, an old rancor, a pool of blood, surviving
from those days when it all happened, and things weren't
dreams. In those days his right arm had a weight in the
world, and he killed.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Then he was cruel too.}
  ◊sarpedon{
He was just, he was merciful. He killed the Chimera.
And now that he's old and exhausted, the gods abandon
him.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{And that's why he roams the countryside?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He's the son of Glaucus and Sisyphus. He fears the
caprices, the ferocity of the gods. He feels himself becoming
a wild animal, and he doesn't want to die. "Boy," he
says to me, "the mockery and treachery is this: first they
strip away your strength and then they despise you for being
less than a man. If you want to live, stop living . . ."
  }
  ◊hippolochus{If that's what he thinks, why doesn't he kill himself?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Nobody kills himself. Death is destiny. All you can
do is want it, Hippolochus.

Old Tiresias, must I believe what they say here in

If it's true that everything comes from the gods, then
you must believe it.
  }
  ◊oedipus{What do ◊em{you} say?}

That there's too much talk about the gods. Being blind
is a misfortune no different from being alive. It is my
experience that disasters strike in their own good time and
strike where they must.
  }
  ◊oedipus{In that case what do the gods do?}
  ◊tiresias{
The world is older than the gods. Before time was born,
the earth was already filling space. It bled, it felt pleasure;
the earth was the only god. In those days things themselves
had power. It was ◊em{things} that happened. Whereas now the
gods turn everything into words, illusions, threats. But the
gods can only make trouble, join things together or pull
them apart. Not touch them, not change them. They came
too late.

  ◊oedipus{This is no way for a priest to be talking.}
  ◊tiresias{
If I didn't know that much, I wouldn't be a priest.
Take the case of a boy who goes swimming in the Asopus.
A morning in summer, say. The boy comes out of the water,
goes back in happily, dives, dives again. Then he gets
cramps and drowns. What do the gods have to do with
this? Should he attribute his death to the gods? Or the
pleasure he had? Neither one. Something has happened
◊; page-number 15
—something which is neither good nor evil, something
which has no name—the gods will give it a name later.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
And to give things names, to explain them, seems to
you a small matter, Tiresias?
  }
  ◊tiresias{
You're young, Oedipus, like the gods. And like them
you explain things by giving them names. You still don't
know that beneath the earth there is rock, and that the
bluest sky is the emptiest. For men like me, for the blind,
all things are a blow. A blow, Oedipus.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
And yet you've spent your life in touch with the gods.
You have meditated on the seasons, on human miseries and
pleasures. Men tell many stories about you, as they would
of a god. And one of them so strange, so improbable, that
it must have some kind of meaning—the kind of meaning
that the clouds have perhaps.
  }
  ◊tiresias{
I have lived a long time. I have lived so long that every
story I hear seems to be my own. What meaning do the
clouds have?
  }
  ◊oedipus{A presence within the emptiness . . .}
  ◊tiresias{But what is this story which you think has a meaning?}
  ◊oedipus{Have you always been the man you are now, Tiresias?}
  ◊tiresias{
Ah, I understand. The story about the snakes. When I
was a woman for seven years. Well, what do you make of
that story?
  }
  ◊oedipus{
It happened to you, and you know it did. But without
a god such things don't happen.
  }
  ◊tiresias{
You think so? On earth anything can happen. There is
nothing which hasn't happened before. In those days I had
feelings of sexual disgust. I felt that my spirit, my sanctity
as a priest, my character, were degraded by sex. When I
saw those two snakes taking their pleasure, making love on
the moss, I couldn't suppress my disgust, I touched them
with my stick. Shortly afterwards I became a woman—and
for years my pride was forced to submit. The things of the
world are rock, Oedipus.
  }
◊; page-number 16
  ◊oedipus{But is the woman's sex really so vile?}
  ◊tiresias{
Not at all. Nothing is vile, except to the gods. There are
irritations, feelings of disgust, and illusions which, when
they reach the rock, vanish. Here the rock was the force of
sex, its ubiquity and omnipresence under all forms and
changes. From man to woman, and vice versa (seven years
later I saw the two serpents again), what I refused to accept
with my spirit was done to me by violence or lust, and I,
proud man or humbled woman, let myself go as a woman
and was passive as a man. And I learned everything about
sex: I reached the point where as a man I looked for men,
and as a woman, looked for women.
  }
  ◊oedipus{You see? A god has taught you something.}
  ◊tiresias{
Above sex there is no god. It is the rock, I tell you.
Many gods are beasts, but the snake is the oldest of all the
gods. When a snake sinks down into the ground—there you
have the image of sex. Life and death are in it. What god
can incarnate and include so much?
  }
  ◊oedipus{You yourself. You said so.}
  ◊tiresias{
Tiresias is old, and he isn't a god. When he was young,
he was ignorant. Sex is ambiguous and always equivocal. It
is an end that seems an everything. Man succeeds in incarnating
it, in living inside it, like a good swimmer in the
water; but meanwhile he has grown old, he has reached
the rock. In the one idea, one illusion, remains: that the
other sex is satisfied. Well, don't believe it. For all of us
it is wasted effort. I know.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
It isn't easy to refute what you say. It's not for nothing
that your story begins with the snakes. But it also begins
with disgust, and sexual fatigue. What would you say to a
healthy man who swore to you that he had never felt disgust?
  }
  ◊tiresias{That he isn't a healthy man. He's still a boy.}
  ◊oedipus{
I have had encounters too, Tiresias, on the streets of
Thebes. And in one of them we talked about man—from
◊; page-number 17
infancy until death—and we too reached the rock. As of
that day I became husband and father, and king of Thebes.
For me in my life, there is nothing ambiguous or wasted.
  }
  ◊tiresias{
You aren't alone, Oedipus, in thinking that. But words
don't reach the rock. May the gods protect you! I too speak
to you, and I am old. Only the blind man knows the darkness.
It seems to me that I live outside time, that I have
lived forever, and I no longer believe in the days. In me too
there is something that feels pleasure and something that
bleeds.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
You were saying that this something was a god. Why,
good Tiresias, don't you try praying to it?
  }
  ◊tiresias{
We all pray to some god, but what happens has no
name. The boy who drowns on a summer morning—what
does he know of the gods? What does it help him to pray?
There is a great snake in every day of life, and it sinks down
and watches us. Have you ever asked yourself, Oedipus, why
the unhappy go blind as they grow old?

That was long ago, Chiron. Now I live beneath the
earth or at the crossroads. Sometimes I see you and your
brothers bounding down from the hills, like great boulders,
vaulting over the ponds and the gorges, racing and calling.
Your hooves, your animal nature I can understand. But
you're more than that. Look at your arms and your chest,
like a man's chest. And that great human laugh of yours.
And the girl who was killed, and her love for the God. And
her friends who are weeping for her now—you're somehow
different things. Your own mother, surely, didn't a god
enjoy her once?
  }
  ◊chiron{
Yes, the world has changed since then. The old god
turned into a stallion to approach her. On the peak of the
mountain it was.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Yes, but answer me this. Coronis was a woman. She
walked through the vineyards and she played with the Bright
One till he killed her and burnt her body.
  }
  ◊chiron{
Hermes, have you ever looked up from Larissa and seen
Mount Olympus profiled against the sky after a night of
wind?
  }
  ◊hermes{Yes. And gone up there too, sometimes.}
  ◊chiron{
So did we once. We galloped up, we raced from ridge
to ridge.

  ◊hermes{Why don't you go back?}
  ◊chiron{Coronis went back, Hermes.}
  ◊hermes{What do you mean by that?}
◊; page-number 22
  ◊chiron{
That mountain is death. That's what I meant. The new
masters live there. They're not like the masters in the old
days, Cronos or the Ancient One. They're not like us as
we used to be, when we bounded among things like the
things we were. In those days wild beasts and swamp brought
gods and men together. We were mountain and horse, plant
and cloud and running water, we were everything then,
everything on earth. Who could die in those days? What was
bestial then, if the beast was in us like the god?
  }
  ◊hermes{
You have girls, Chiron, and they are mortal women or
mares, as they please. Why complain? Here you centaurs
have the mountain, the plain, the seasons. There is everything
here you could ask for, even human houses, huts, and
villages down there by the mouth of the valley, and stables
and firesides where poor mortals tell tales about you and
are always glad to welcome you. Don't you think the world
is governed better by the new masters?
  }
  ◊chiron{
You're one of them and you take their side. But once
you were bull sperm and bestial rage, Hermes. Now you
lead the bloodless shades down to the world below. What
are men but shadows before their time? But I'm happy to
think that the child's mother leapt down on her own. If
she found nothing else, she found herself as she died.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Now I know why she died. She climbed the slopes of
the mountain, she was a woman and she gave the God such
love that she bore his child. The God has no pity, you say.
But do you really think Coronis left her animal desires
behind her in the swamps? Did she leave behind the shapeless
frenzy of the blood which spawned her?
  }
  ◊chiron{Of course she didn't. What then?}
  ◊hermes{
The new gods of Olympus are always smiling, but there's
one thing at which they do not smile. Believe me, I've seen
destiny. Whenever chaos spills over into the light, into
◊; page-number 23
their light, then they must strike down and destroy and
remake. That is why Coronis died.
  }
  ◊chiron{
But they can't remake Coronis. I was right when I told
you that Olympus is death.
  }
  ◊hermes{
But the Bright One loved her. If he were not a god he
would have mourned her. He snatched the child from her
body—he gives it to you joyfully. He knows that only you
can make a true man of him.
  }
  ◊chiron{
I have already told you what his fate will be in the
homes of men. He will be Asclepius, the lord of bodies, a
man-god. He will live among festering flesh and sighs. Men
will turn to him to escape their fate, to hold back by one
night, by a single instant, the pains of death. This little
child will walk between life and death, like you, Hermes,
who once were bull sperm and now are only the guide of
the shades. This is what the Olympians have in store for
mortal men.
  }
  ◊hermes{
But isn't it better for men to die like this than come
to that ancient damnation, to mate with beast or tree, to
become lowing bull or crawling snake, to become eternal
rock or weeping spring?

Yes. So long as Olympus is heaven. But Olympus too
shall pass.

  ◊thanatos{
Wherever an immortal has been, these flowers bloom.
But in the past there was at least some pretext, an attempt
to escape or an offense of some sort. They struggled against
The god or were guilty of some wickedness. It was that way
with Daphne and with Actaeon. But Hyacinth was only a
boy. He lived his life doing honor to his master. He played
with the god the way a child plays. He was excited, bewildered.
You know this, Eros.

  ◊eros{
Mortals are already saying it was an accident. No one stops
to think that the Bright One rarely misses.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
All I saw was his frowning smile as he followed the
flight of the discus and watched it come down. He threw it
high into the sun, and Hyacinth looked up and raised his
hands and waited for it, dazzled. Why did this happen,
Eros? You surely must know.
  }
  ◊eros{
What can I say, Thanatos? I can't be moved to pity by a
god's whim. And you know as well as I do that when a god
◊; page-number 27
approaches a mortal, something cruel always happens. It
was you who spoke of Daphne and Actaeon.
  }
  ◊thanatos{But what happened this time?}
  ◊eros{
A whim, as I said. The Bright One wanted to play, he
came down among men and he saw Hyacinth. For six days
he lived in Amyclae, six days which changed Hyacinth's
whole life and reshaped the world for him. Finally, the lord
wanted to go away and Hyacinth looked at him, bewildered.
So the discus fell and struck him between the eyes.
  }
  ◊thanatos{Maybe Apollo didn't want him to cry.}
  ◊eros{
No, the Bright One doesn't know what crying is. We know
it, though, we young gods and daemons who were alive
when Olympus was still bare rock. We have seen many
things, we have seen even trees and stones weep. But the
lord is different. Six days, a life—they're all the same to
him. No one knew this better than Hyacinth.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
Did he really know these things? Didn't he perhaps
think of the god as a model, an older friend, a brother he
trusted and looked up to? I only saw him when he raised
his arms to play the game—there was nothing in his eyes
but trust and awe. No, Hyacinth didn't know who the
Bright One was.
  }
  ◊eros{
Perhaps, Thanatos. Perhaps he didn't even know about
Actaeon and Daphne. It's hard to tell where fear stops and
trust begins. But certainly he spent six days of intense
experience.
  }
  ◊thanatos{What do you think he really felt?}
  ◊eros{
What every young person feels. But this time the center
of his thoughts and actions was too much, too much for a
boy. He was with the stranger everywhere; wherever the
god was, he was—where men wrestled, in the rooms of the
palace, beside the Eurotas, talking to him, listening to him.
He listened to the god's stories about Delos and Delphi,
about Typho and Thessaly and the land of Hyperboreans.
◊; page-number 28
One thing is certain, the god said nothing of his
home on Olympus, of the other immortals, of divine things.
No, he talked about himself and his sister, about the Graces,
in the way people talk of ordinary life: wonderful, but ordinary.
Sometimes they listened together to a wandering poet
who was staying for the night.
  }
  ◊thanatos{Nothing wrong in all this.}
  ◊eros{
Nothing indeed, very reassuring. Hyacinth learned that
the lord of Delos, with those indescribable eyes and his
quiet way of speaking, had seen and experienced things
which might happen someday to him. The god spoke of
him too and of his fate. The everyday life of Amyclae was
an open book to him. He made plans for the future, he
treated Hyacinth like an equal, like someone of his own
age, and the names of Aglaia, Eurynome, and Auxo, distant
smiling women, young women, who had lived with the god
in strange intimacy—he spoke their names casually, calmly,
with an idle relish that made Hyacinth shiver. This was
how the boy lived, and felt. When he was with the god,
everything seemed easy and clear. He felt he could do anything.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
I've known other men too. Men of experience, wiser,
stronger than Hyacinth. And every one of them was destroyed
by this craving to do everything.
  }
  ◊eros{
But in Hyacinth it was only hope, a trembling hope of
becoming like the stranger. But the god refused the enthusiasm
he read in the boy's eyes—it was enough to arouse
it. What he saw in his eyes and his curly hair was the
beautiful purpled flower that was Hyacinth's fate. He paid
no attention to words or tears—he had come to see a
flower. And this flower had to be worthy of him, something
at once wonderful and ordinary, like the memory of the
Graces. So, tranquilly, he created the flower.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
We are ferocious things, we immortals. I wonder how
◊; page-number 29
long the Olympians will make destiny. They dare everything:
that may destroy them too.
  }
  ◊eros{
Who can tell? From the time of chaos, there has been
nothing but blood. Men's blood, blood of monsters, of gods.
We begin and we die in blood. How do you think you were
born, Thanatos?
  }
  ◊thanatos{
In order to be born, a thing must die: even men know
that. But the Olympians don't know it, they've forgotten it.
In a world that passes, they endure. They don't exist, they
◊em{are}. Their every whim is a fatal law. To express a flower, they
destroy a man.
  }
  ◊eros{
Yes, Thanatos. But shouldn't we take into account the
richness of feeling which Hyacinth experienced? That
tremulous hope in which he died was also his birth. He was
a boy, his mind was still fresh and unformed, still muffled
in the early mists of childhood, the son of Amyclas, the
unimportant king of an unimportant country—what would
he have been without the stranger from Delos?
  }
  ◊thanatos{A man among men, Eros.}
  ◊eros{
I know. And I know too that no one escapes his fate.
But it's not my way to be moved by a god's whim. Hyacinth
lived six days in the shadow of a light. He lacked
nothing—he knew perfect joy, he knew its rapid, bitter end.
Which is something that the Olympians and the immortals
do not know. What more could he ask, Thanatos?

berry, became something wild, something untouchable,

caught within the circles of her eyes, in the space she filled,
the clearing, and the hill. She smiled at me, timidly. "Lady,"
I said to her, and she frowned, like a girl, like a shy, wild
thing, as though she understood that I was amazed, somehow
dismayed, to find myself calling her Lady. The dismay
I felt then was always between us.

smile. I thought of all the names men call her by, and I
would have fallen to my knees but she held me up, as one
holds up a child, by putting her hand under my chin. Look
at me, I'm a grown man. And she was just a wild thing, a
slight awkward girl. Except for her eyes, those eyes of hers.
I felt like a small boy. "You must never wake again," she
said. "Don't try to follow me. I'll come to you again." And
she went off through the clearing.

I walked all over Latmos that night, until dawn. I followed
the moon everywhere, through the gorges and the
scrub, up to the peaks. I listened, listened, and all I could
hear was her voice, like the sound of sea water, a hoarse
voice, cold and maternal. Every rustle, every shadow stopped
me. I caught glimpses of wild animals, running. When the
light came—a livid, veiled light—I looked down on the
plain, on this road where we're walking now, and I knew
that my home was no longer among men. I was no longer
one of them. I was waiting for the night.

flesh turned stone. The shed blood, the savaged flesh, the

beasts are wilderness. Her caresses are like the caresses you

Why, Sappho? Fate is joy, and when you sang your

I was never happy, Britomart. Desire is not song. It
destroys, and burns, like a snake, like the wind.
  }
  ◊britomart{
But have you ever known mortal women who lived
peacefully in desire and tumult?
  }
  ◊sappho{
None. Wait, yes, perhaps . . . But not mortal women
like Sappho. You were still a mountain nymph, I wasn't yet
born, when a woman crossed this sea, a mortal woman, who
lived always in storm and strife. Perhaps she was in peace.
She killed, destroyed, blinded. She was like a goddess—
always herself, unchanging. Perhaps she didn't even have to
smile. She was lovely, no fool, and around her there was
nothing but fighting and death. Men fought and died for
her, Britomart, asking only for her name to be joined to
theirs for a moment, for her name to be given to their living
and dying. And they smiled for her. You know her—Helen,
the daughter of Leda.
  }
  ◊britomart{And she, was she happy?}
  ◊sappho{
At least she didn't run away, that much is certain. She
was sufficient unto herself. She didn't ask what her fate was.
Whoever had the will—and the strength—carried her off.
For ten years she followed a hero; they took her away from
him and married her to another man. He too lost her, countless
men fought for her across the seas. Then the second
man took her back and she lived with him, at peace. She
was buried, and in Hades she knew even more men. She lied
to no one, she smiled at no one. Perhaps she was happy.
  }
  ◊britomart{And you envy this woman?}
  ◊sappho{
I envy no one. I wanted to die. It's not enough for me
to be someone else, and if I can't be Sappho, I would sooner
be nothing.

What's so hard about that? It's part of your fate. But
what does it mean?
  }
  ◊britomart{It means accepting, and accepting oneself.}
  ◊sappho{
Yes, but what does it ◊em{mean?} How can you accept a force
that seizes you and turns you into desire, into shuddering
desire that struggles over a body, a man's or a girl's, like
the foam between the rocks? And this body rejects you and
crushes you, and you fall and long to embrace the rock, to
accept it. Sometimes you are the rock yourself, and the foam
and the tumult are twisting at your feet. No
one is ever at peace. How can one accept all this?
  }
  ◊britomart{
You have to accept it. You tried to run away, Sappho,
and where are you now? A bit of frothing wave.
  }
  ◊sappho{
But don't you feel it, Britomart, this langour, this deep
tidal unrest? Everything here is torn and tormented endlessly.
Even dead things go on struggling.
  }
  ◊britomart{
You should know the sea, Sappho. You came from
an island.
  }
  ◊sappho{
Oh Britomart, even when I was a child it frightened
me. That ceaseless life is monotonous, sad . . . There are no
words for the weariness of it.
  }
  ◊britomart{
Once in my island I saw people coming and going.
There were women like you, Sappho, women who lived for
love. They never looked sad or tired to me.
  }
  ◊sappho{
I know, Britomart, I know. But did you follow them
on their journeys? There was one woman who hanged herself
from her own roof beam in a foreign land. And one
who woke up one morning on a rock, abandoned. And the
others, so many others, from all the islands and all the lands
who went down to the sea. Some were enslaved, some were
tortured, some killed their own children. There were some
who toiled night and day, and some who never touched
solid land again and became things, creatures of the sea.
  }
  ◊britomart{But Helen—she came out unscathed, you said?}
◊; page-number 44

Sowing fire and slaughter. She smiled at no one, she lied
to no one. She was a woman worthy of the sea. But Britomart,
do you remember who was born over there?

  ◊britomart{Who do you mean?}
  ◊sappho{
There is one island you've never seen. Every morning
when the sun rises, it touches this island first.
  }
  ◊britomart{Oh Sappho.}
  ◊sappho{
It was there she sprang from the sea, the goddess who
has no name, the tormented, restless one who smiles to
herself.
  }
  ◊britomart{But she doesn't suffer. She is a great goddess.}
  ◊sappho{
And everything that is torn and tortured in the sea is
her substance and her breath. Have you seen her, Britomart?}
  ◊britomart{
Oh Sappho, don't ask me. I'm only one of the little
nymphs.

In her presence we all run away. Don't speak of her,

Meleager's life was linked to a brand which his mother

god's eyes, Hermes. Whereas I was only Meleager, a hunter

my life by the hearth, and when I was born my fate was
already contained in the brand my mother pulled from the
fire. A few friends, the wild animals—this was all I ever
knew.

marked with the sign of strange destinies.

  ◊meleager{
A mother . . . None of them had a mother like mine.
Nobody knows what it means to know that your life lies in
her hands, and to feel yourself blazing, and those eyes fixed
on the fire. Why did she draw the brand from the fire the
day I was born? Why didn't she let me crumble into ashes?
And I had to grow up, to become Meleager, to cry and
play, go hunting, to watch the winter and the seasons, to
be a man—but always knowing the other thing, carrying
that weight within me, daily seeing my fate in her eyes.
That's what hurts. An enemy is nothing.
  }

You're strange, you mortals. The thing you already know
amazes you. That an enemy is nothing is obvious. He has
a mother too, like anybody else. So why can't you accept
the knowledge that your life lies in her hands?

  ◊meleager{
Hermes, we hunters have an agreement. When we
climb the mountain, each man helps the other. Each holds
the other's life in his hands; he never betrays his friend.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Fool, a friend is always betrayed . . . But that's not it.
Your lives are forever contained in the burning brand, and
your mother draws you from the fire, and you live half
blazing. The passion of which you die is your mother's
passion, smouldering on in you. What are you but her flesh and blood?
  }
  ◊meleager{
It was her eyes, Hermes. You have to have seen those
eyes. Seen them from childhood on, to know them, live with
them, to feel them fixed on your every step, your every
action, for days, for years, and to know that they're getting
old, that they're dying, and to suffer what they suffer, to
hurt yourself by hurting them, to go in terror of offending
them. It's then that their staring at the fire, their watching
the brand as it burns, becomes unbearable.
  }
◊; page-number 48

You know this too, and it surprises you, Meleager? The
fact that those eyes grow old and die means that in the
interval you become a man, and knowing that you offend
them, you go somewhere else in search of them—live eyes,
true eyes. And if you find them—and one always finds them,
Meleager—the person they belong to is again your mother.
And then you no longer know with whom you have to deal,
and you're almost happy. But there's one thing you can be
certain of—they know. Both of them alike, the old she and
the young ones. And no one can escape the fate that has
marked him from birth with the sign of the fire.
  }
  ◊meleager{Has anyone else had my fate, Hermes?}
  ◊hermes{
Everyone, Meleager. Everyone. The same death awaits
them all. They all die of another's passion. In every man's
flesh and blood, his mother rages. True, many men are
cowards, worse cowards than you.

  ◊hermes{
I speak to you as a shade, not as a mortal. So long as a
man doesn't know, he's brave.

I'm no coward now, not here, seeing what I see. I
know many things now. But I don't believe that she—the
young she—knew anything about those eyes.

Atalanta . . . Will she become a mother too? Could
she stare at the fire? Atalanta?

  ◊hermes{
See if you can remember what she said to you, the night
when you killed the boar.
  }
  ◊meleager{
That night. The night of the pact. I haven't forgotten
that night, Hermes. Atalanta was furious because I'd let the
boar escape in the snow. She struck at me with her axe and
hit me on the shoulder. I barely felt the blow, but I burst
out, even angrier than she, "Get back to the house, Atalanta!
Go back with the women! This is no place for your silly
outbursts." And later that evening when the boar was
killed, Atalanta walked beside me, among the other hunters,
◊; page-number 49
and handed me the axe. She'd gone back alone to look for
it in the snow. That evening we made a pact that when we
went out hunting, one of us would take no weapons. That
way the other wouldn't be tempted by anger.
  }
  ◊hermes{And what did Atalanta say?}
  ◊meleager{
I remember clearly, Hermes. "Son of Althaea", she
said, "the boarskin will lie on our marriage-bed. It will be
like your blood-price—yours and mine." And she smiled, as
though asking for forgiveness.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Meleager, no mortal succeeds in thinking of his mother
as a girl. But don't you think the person who could say such
words would be capable of staring at the fire? It was old
Althaea who killed you, for a blood-price.
  }
  ◊meleager{
Hermes, all this is my fate. But surely there must have
been mortals who lived full lives, men whose lives didn't lie
in somebody else's hands . . .
  }
  ◊hermes{
Do you know of any, Meleager? They would be gods.
Oh, a few cowards may have succeeded in hiding, but they
too carried their mothers' blood, and sooner or later the
hatred, the passion, the rage blazed out in their hearts. On
some evening of life even they felt themselves blazing
again. Not all of you, true, have died of this. All of you,
when you know, lead the life of the dead. Believe me,
Meleager, you were lucky.

But not even to see my own children, barely to know
my own bed . . .

You've been lucky. Your children will not be born. Your
bed is empty. Your friends go hunting as they did before
you existed. You are a shade, a nothing.

  ◊meleager{And Atalanta? What about her?}
  ◊hermes{
The house is empty as it used to be when night was
falling and you and the men came home late from hunting.
Atalanta, who drove you to revenge, is not dead. The two
women live together without speaking. They stare at the

hearth where your mother's brother was murdered and
where you became ashes. Maybe they don't even hate each
other. They know each other too well. Without a man,

I recognize you, though. It takes more than a drop of
wine to down Patroclus. This evening I know that when all
is said and done there's no difference between us and the
common run of men. There is a worst for all of us. It's the
last thing to come and it stuffs your mouth like a fistful of
earth. Oh, it's all very well to be able to say, "I've seen this,
I've suffered that," but isn't it unjust that when the cruelest

Well, at least one of us will be able to remember for

Everything I've done has been done with you. And as
you would do it.

What I mean is, when we were always together, playing
and hunting, and the day was short but the years never
passed, did you know then what death was, your death? A
boy can kill himself, but he doesn't know what death is.
Then suddenly comes the day when you understand, death
is inside you, and from that moment on you're a grown man.

remember. It seems to me that I've always drunk, that I
never knew what death was.

I will. But for you death doesn't exist. And the man who
doesn't fear death is not a good soldier.

  ◊patroclus{And yet I'm with you tonight, drinking.}
  ◊achilles{
But haven't you any memories, Patroclus? Don't you
ever say: "I've done this, I've seen that," and asked yourself
what you've really done, what sort of live you've led,
what mark you have left on the world? What good is it to
live if we leave no memories behind us?
  }
  ◊patroclus{
When we were boys together, Achilles, we remembered
nothing. Just being together all day was enough.
  }
  ◊achilles{
Does anyone in Thessaly still remember those days,
I wonder? And when this war is over and our comrades go
home, who will walk the streets we used to walk, who will
know that we were once boys there too—two boys no different
from any others there now? Do the boys who are
growing up there know what's waiting for them?

Yes, but haven't we seen a good many already,
Achilles?

  ◊achilles{
No, Patroclus, not so many! The day will come when
we are corpses. When our mouths will be stuffed with a
fistful of earth. And we won't even know what we've seen.
  }
  ◊patroclus{Why think of these things?}
  ◊achilles{
How not think of them? A boy's like an immortal, he
looks and laughs. He doesn't know what things cost. He
doesn't know the sweat and the bitterness. His fighting is

a game. He throws himself down on the ground and plays
dead, then he laughs and goes on with the game.

But we have other games. Women and plunder. The
enemy. And our drinking together at night. Achilles, when
are we going back to the fighting?

We're going back, you can be sure of that. A destiny
awaits us. When you see ships on fire, that will be the

Does waiting frighten you? Haven't you seen worse
than this?

it off. Why not tomorrow?

There's no hurry, Patroclus. Let the gods say Tomorrow.
It's only for them that what has been will be.

But whether or not we can say, I've seen worse than
this—that depends on us. To the very end. So drink,
Achilles. Drink to the spear, drink to the shield. What has
been will be again. We'll go back to the fighting, the danger.

No more than an old servant or a beggar. They've been
young too.

You're rich, Achilles, and for you wealth is just a rag
to be thrown away. It's only a man like you who can compare
himself to a beggar. You, the man who stormed the
citadel of Tenedos and tore the girdle of the Amazon and
fought with bears on the hills. What other child was tempered
by his mother on the fire? You are sword and spear,

to Hades, to rescue me.

It was better when there was no Hades. When we wandered
through the forests and by the streams and washed
the sweat off our bodies, when we were boys . . . Every
gesture, then, every motion, was a game. We were memory

matter. I know that on the centaur's mountain it was summer,
it was winter, it was all of life. We were immortal.

Your memories would have been poor then, Achilles.
Better to suffer than never to have lived.

But how could I tell that life was to be like this? Oh

Then I'll go alone. And to put you to shame, I'll take
your spear.

I wasn't born when they cut down the ash to make it.
I wonder if the clearing in the woods is still there.

Come and fight, and you'll see that your spear is
worthy of you. An enemy for every stump.

didn't meet the Sphinx and no oracle had spoken of me,
I've enjoyed the life I made for myself. You were my oracle,
you transformed my life, my fate. Beggar or prince, what's
the difference? Both of us have lived. Leave the rest to

You'll never know if what you've done is what you
really wanted. But certainly there's something human,

something uniquely human, in walking the open road. Tortuous,
lonely, it is an image of the sorrow that eats us away.
A sorrow which is almost relief, like rain after heat: so still,
so tranquil that it seems as though it welled up from things,
from the depth of the heart. This fatigue, this peace, after
all the uproar of our destiny—they're perhaps the only
things that are truly our own.

There was a time when we didn't exist, Oedipus. That
means that even the deepest desires of our heart, our blood,
our moments of awakening, have sprung from nothing. Even
your desire to escape destiny is perhaps destiny. It isn't we
who made our own blood. It's enough to feel it and live
like free men, as the oracle bids us.

Yes, as long as a man is still searching. You had the
luck never to reach your goal. But the day comes when you
go back the Cithaeron, you forget everything and the mountain
seems to bring back your childhood. You look at it day
after day and maybe you climb it. Then someone tells you
that you were born up there. And everything crumbles.

I understand, Oedipus. But we all have a mountain

Talking is one thing, friend, suffering another. But
certainly talking brings a kind of comfort to the heart. Like
walking the roads day and night as we do, with no goal in
sight. Not like the travels of young men seeking their fortune.

you really want to be king?

In world history, the era named after the Titans was
peopled with men and monsters and with gods not

Prometheus, you keep me here talking, and every moment

you free.

I know, Heracles. I knew when you were still only
a baby in swaddling clothes, I knew before you were even
born. But I'm like someone who has suffered a great deal

comes for him to go, he can hardly bring himself to leave
the place where he's suffered so much.

I must leave it, Heracles—I said I was expecting
you. But this is a hard moment, as hard for me as for the

You suffer till you want to die. One day you will

I cannot die. For that matter, you won't die either, Heracles.

goodness.

Why not? Doesn't everything we have come from
them?
  }
  ◊prometheus{
Oh Heracles, there's a wisdom more ancient than
theirs. The world is old, older than this rock. Even they
know that. Everything has a destiny. But the gods are young,
almost as young as you are.
  }
  ◊heracles{Aren't you a god too?}
  ◊prometheus{
I will be someday. So destiny wills. But once I was
a Titan and I lived in a world without gods. Yes, there was
such a world. Can you imagine it, Heracles?

Every man has his rock—that is why I love men.
It's only the gods who don't yet know the rock. They
don't know how to laugh or cry. They smile at destiny.

  ◊heracles{Who nailed you here, Prometheus? Tell me that.}
  ◊prometheus{
Oh Heracles, the victor is always a god. So long as
the Titan-man struggles and endures, he can laugh and cry.
And if they nail you here, or you climb your mountain, that
◊; page-number 66
is the victory that fate allows you. We should be grateful
for this. What is a victory but pity turned gesture, saving
others at your own expense? Everyone works for others,
under the law of destiny. Even I, Heracles, if I am freed
today, owe it to someone.

I've had harder tasks than this, Prometheus. Besides,
I haven't freed you yet.

I'm not talking about you, Heracles. You're brave
and compassionate. But you've already done your job.

You wouldn't be a man if you knew what was destined.
But you live in a world of gods, and the gods have
taken this knowledge from you too. You know nothing and
you've already done everything. Remember the centaur.
  }
  ◊heracles{The beast-man I killed this morning?}
  ◊prometheus{
Monsters can't be killed. Not even the gods can
do that. A day will come when you'll think you've killed a
second monster, far less human than the first, and all you'll
have done is prepare your rock. Do you know who you
struck down this morning?
  }
  ◊heracles{A centaur.}
  ◊prometheus{
It was Chiron you killed, the good, compassionate
Chiron, friend of Titans and men.
  }
  ◊heracles{Oh Prometheus . . .}
  ◊prometheus{
Don't be troubled, Heracles. Our fates are fused.
By the world's law, no one goes free unless another's blood
is shed for him. The same will happen with you, on Mt.
Oeta. And Chiron knew this.
  }
  ◊heracles{You mean he sacrificed himself?}
  ◊prometheus{
What else? Just as once I knew that the theft of
fire would mean my rock.
  }
  ◊heracles{
Let me untie you, Prometheus. Then you can tell me
all about Chiron and Mt. Oeta.
  }
  ◊prometheus{
I'm free already. I could be released only if someone
◊; page-number 67
took my place. Chiron let himself be struck down by you;
and you were sent by fate. But in this world born of chaos
there is a law of justice. Pity, fear, and courage are only
its instruments. Whatever is done must one day recur. The
blood which you have shed, which you will shed will drive
you up to Oeta to die your own death there. It will be the
blood of the monsters which you now live to destroy. And
the pyre you mount will burn with the fire I stole.
  }
  ◊heracles{But you told me I couldn't die.}
  ◊prometheus{
Death entered this world with the gods. You mortals
fear death because you know that the gods, by being gods,
are immortal. But everyone has the death he deserves. Their
day will come too.
  }
  ◊heracles{What do you mean, Prometheus?}
  ◊prometheus{
Not everything can be explained. But always remember
that monsters do not die. What dies is the fear they
inspire. So with the gods: when men no longer fear them,
they will vanish.
  }
  ◊heracles{And will the Titans return then?}
  ◊prometheus{
Rocks and forests don't return. They are. What
has been will be.
  }
  ◊heracles{
And yet you Titans were changed by the gods. You too,
Prometheus.
  }
  ◊prometheus{
Titan is a name, nothing more. Understand me,
Heracles. The world has its seasons, like the fields, like the
earth. Winter returns, summer returns. How can we say
that the forest dies, or remains the same? Before long, men
will be the Titans.

  ◊orpheus{
This is how it happened. We were climbing the path
through the Forest of Shadows. Cocytus, the Styx, Charon's
skiff, and the screams of the damned were far behind us.
Reflected on the leaves I could just make out the first
glimmer of the sky. But I was still down there in Hades,
and that chill was still with me. I was thinking that someday
I would have to go back down, that what has been will be
again. I was thinking of my life with her, how it had been
before; someday it would have to finish again. What has
been, will be. I was thinking of that cold, of that emptiness
I had passed through and which she was carrying with her
in her bones, in her marrow, her blood. Was it worth the
anguish of coming back to life? I was thinking of this, when
I saw the first glimmer of the light. Then I said, "Let's
finish it once and for all." And I turned around. Eurydice
disappeared like a snuffed candle. All I heard was a faint
squeal, like a mouse skittering to its hole.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
A strange story, Orpheus. I can barely believe it.
People here used to say that you were loved by the gods
and the Muses. And like me, many Bacchantes follow you
because they know you're in love and unhappy. You were
so much in love that you alone among men have gone
through the gates of nothingness. No, I don't believe you,
Orpheus. It isn't your fault if destiny misled you.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Destiny has nothing to do with it. My destiny does not
mislead. It's absurd that after such a journey, after looking
◊; page-number 71
nothingness in the face, I should have turned around on a
sudden impulse, or by mistake.
  }
  ◊bacchante{Here they say you did it for love.}
  ◊orpheus{Nobody loves the dead.}
  ◊bacchante{
And yet you mourned her, wandering the mountains
and hills—searching for her, calling her. You went down
into Hades. Wasn't that love?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
You claim to see things like a man. Then you must
know that there's nothing a man can do with death. The
Eurydice I mourned was a season of life. I was looking down
there for something very different from my love. I was looking
for a past which Eurydice knows nothing of. I understood
this among the dead while I was singing my song. I
saw the shades stiffen and stare vacantly, heard the lamentation
stop. Persephone hid her face, and Hades himself, the
inscrutable lord of the shadows, leaned forward like a mortal
man and listened. I understood that the dead are nothing.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Grief has distracted your mind, Orpheus. Who
wouldn't want his past again? Eurydice was almost reborn.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Reborn for what? Only to die all over again, Bacchante.
To carry in her blood the horror of Hades and to tremble
at my side night and day. You don't know what nothingness
is.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Through your singing you had recovered the past.
But instead you rejected it and destroyed it. No, I can't
believe it.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Listen, Bacchante. Only in my song was the past real.
No sooner had I started on the way back than that past
vanished away, became memory, tasted of death. When I
saw the first flicker of light, I jumped for joy like a child,
barely believing it. It was joy for myself, selfish joy, joy for
the world of the living. The season I had been searching
for was there in that glimmer of light. The woman following
me no longer mattered. My past was that first glimmer of light,
it was the song, and the morning. And I turned around.
  }
◊; page-number 72

I can't believe it, Orpheus. How could you have endured
such a loss? Those who saw your face when you came
back were frightened. For you Eurydice was a season of life.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Nonsense. When Eurydice died, she became something
else. The Orpheus who went down into Hades was no longer
either husband or widower. The grief I felt at the same time was
like the grief of a child—you smile when you remember it.
That season is over. When I wept, I was no longer looking
for her, but for myself. For a fate, if you like. I was listening
to myself.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Many of us follow you because we believe in your
sorrow. Have you misled us then?

Oh Bacchante, Bacchante, why won't you understand?
My destiny does not mislead. I was looking for myself. What
else can one look for?
  }

We're simple people, Orpheus. Here we believe in
love and death; we laugh and feel sorrow with others. Our
most joyful festivals are those in which blood flows. The
women of Thrace are not afraid of things like this.

If life is all you know, everything is beautiful. But once
you've been among the dead . . . Believe me, you can't say
that.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You weren't like this once. You didn't use to talk
about nothingness. It's the encounter with death that makes
us like gods. It was you yourself who taught us that ecstasy
confounds life and death and makes us more than human
. . . You've seen the festival.

mountains—
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Time passes, Bacchante. The mountains are still there,
Eurydice isn't. These things have a name, and their name
is man. Invoking the gods of your rite is no help here.
  }
  ◊bacchante{You once invoked them too.}
  ◊orpheus{
In life a man does everything. Believes everything. He
even believes that his own blood runs in the veins of others.
Or that what has been can be undone. He believes his ecstasy
can shatter fate. I know all this, and it is nothing.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You don't know what to make of death, Orpheus,
and yet death is your only thought. There was a time when
our rite made us immortal.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Go on then, enjoy your rite. Only your ignorance makes
it possible. Everyone must descend at least once into his
own private hell. The ritual of my destiny ended in Hades,
when I sang, as only I have the right to sing, of death and
life.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You say your destiny doesn't mislead. What do you
mean?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
I mean that it's inside you, the fact of your being,
deeper than blood, beyond all ecstasy. No god can touch it.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Perhaps, Orpheus. But we aren't looking for Eurydice.
So why tell us that we all must go down to hell?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Every time you invoke a god, you meet death. And you
go down to Hades to bring something back, to violate a
destiny. You don't defeat the darkness, and you lose the
light. You're torn apart, like a man possessed.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You're evil, Orpheus . . . You mean you lost the
light?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
I was almost lost, and then I sang. By comprehension
I found myself.
  }
◊; page-number 74
  ◊bacchante{
If that's the price, is it worth it? There's a simpler
way, the way of ignorance and joy. The god is like a lord,
midway between life and death. You yield to his ecstasy,
you're torn to pieces and you tear others to pieces. And
we're reborn, Orpheus, every time, and we waken—like you
when you returned to the light.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Don't talk of daylight, of waking. Few men know.
Women like you don't know what it is.

Maybe this is why the women of Thrace follow you.
For them you're like the god. You came down from the
mountains. You sing songs of love and death . . .

you'll be like a man.
