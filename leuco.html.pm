  ◊p[#:class "intro"]{
Had it been possible, I would gladly have done without all
this mythology. But myth, it seems to me, is a language of
its own, an instrument of expression. There is nothing arbitrary
about it. It is a seedbed of symbolic forms, possessing, like
all languages, its own rage of meanings which can be
conveyed in no other way. When we retell an old myth—a
proper name, an action, a heroic feat—we are expressing, with
the utmost economy of means, a general and comprehensive
fact, a core of reality which quickens and feeds a whole
organic growth of passion and human existence, an entire
conceptual complex. If this mythical name or action also
happens to be familiar to us from childhood, from our
schooldays, so much the better. What is more acutely
disturbing than to see familiar stories troubled into new life?
In these dialogues I have confined myself to Greek
mythology. For obvious reasons these myths have never lost
their popularity; they can count on both an immediate and a
traditional acceptance. At all costs I wanted to avoid
whatever is shapeless, irregular, accidental; even in subject
matter, I wanted to confine myself within a given frame; I
have tried for a concrete, finite presence. A true revelation,
I am convinced, can only emerge from stubborn concentration
on a single problem. I have nothing in common with
experimentalists, adventurers, with those who travel in strange
regions. The surest, and the quickest, way for us to arouse the
sense of wonder is to stare, unafraid, at a single object.
Suddenly—miraculously—it will look like something we have
never seen before.

  ◊dialogue-title{The Cloud}
  ◊dialogue-intro{
It seems likely that Ixion was condemned to Tartarus
because of his presumptions. But that he fathered the
Centaurs on the clouds is false, since the race of Centaurs
already existed at the time of his son's marriage.
The Lapiths and the Centaurs belong to the age
of the Titans, when very different creatures
were still permitted to mate and interbreed. The
result was that swarm of monsters which Olympus
later pursued with implacable hatred.

  ◊cloud{Ixion, there is a law and we must obey it.}
  ◊ixion{
The law has no power here, Nephele. Here the law is the
glacier, the storm, the darkness. And when at last the
weather clears and you drift softly toward the peak, it's no
time then to be thinking about the law.
  }
  ◊cloud{
There is a law, Ixion, which didn't exist before. A
stronger hand now masses the clouds.
  }
  ◊ixion{
That hand doesn't reach here. Look, the weather's clear,
and you're laughing, aren't you? And when the sky turns
black and the wind howls, who cares about the hand that
scatters us like rain? That was what happened in the days
when there was no master. Nothing has changed up here on
the mountains. We're used to all this.
  }
  ◊cloud{
Much has changed on the mountains. Pelion knows
it. Ossa and Olympus know it. Wilder mountains know it
too.
  }
  ◊ixion{What has changed on the mountains, Nephele?}
  ◊cloud{
Not the sun, not the rain, Ixion. Man's fate has
changed. There are monsters. A limit has been imposed
upon you mortals. The rain, the wind, the peak, and the
clouds are no longer yours to possess. You can no longer
hold them in your arms, live with them. Other hands now
hold the world. There is a law, Ixion.
  }
  ◊ixion{What law?}
  ◊cloud{You already know. Your fate, the limit imposed
upon you—
  }
◊; page-number 3
  ◊ixion{
I hold my fate in my fist, Nephele. What has changed?
Can these new masters stop me from throwing boulders
for the joy of it? Or from going down to the plain and
breaking an enemy's back? Are they any more terrible than
fatigue and death?
  }
  ◊cloud{
That's not it, Ixion. You can still do all that, and
more besides. But you can no longer mate with us, the
nymphs of the wind, the goddesses of the earth. Destiny has
changed.
  }
  ◊ixion{No longer? What do you mean, Nephele?}
  ◊cloud{
I mean that if you try to do what you once did, you'll
do something terrible. Like a man who tries to embrace a
friend and strangle him, or is strangled himself.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I don't understand. You mean you're leaving the mountain?
You're afraid of me?
  }
  ◊cloud{
I'll be here on the mountain, here and everywhere.
But I'm out of your reach, Ixion. You're powerless against
the rain and the wind. You must bow your head. That's
your only salvation.
  }
  ◊ixion{You're afraid, Nephele.}
  ◊cloud{
Yes, I'm afraid. I've seen the mountain peaks. But
I'm not afraid for myself, Ixion. I cannot suffer. I'm afraid
for you—you who are only men. These mountains where
you were once the masters, where you used to run, and
these creatures, our children, conceived when we were both
free, now tremble at a nod. We are all the slaves of a
stronger hand. The Centaurs, sons of the wind and the
rain, are hiding in the deep ravines. They know they are
monsters.
  }
  ◊ixion{Who says so?}
  ◊cloud{
Don't defy that hand, Ixion. It is fate. I've seen
others, more reckless than you or the Centaurs, hurl themselves
from the cliff and not die. Understand me, Ixion.
◊; page-number 4
Death, in which your courage was defined, can be taken
from you, like a blessing refused. Do you know this?
  }
  ◊ixion{
You've told me so before. What does it matter? We'll
live more intensely.
  }
  ◊cloud{You can't be serious. You don't know the immortals.}
  ◊ixion{I want to know them, Nephele.}
  ◊cloud{
Ixion, you think they're presences like us, like Night,
Earth, or old Pan. You're young, Ixion, but you were born
under the old dispensation. For you there are no monsters,
there are only friends. For you death is something that
happens, like day, like night. You're one of us, Ixion. What
you are is what you do, and that is all. But for them, the
immortals, everything you do has a meaning that lingers.
And they probe everything from far off, with their eyes,
their nostrils, their lips. They are immortal and they cannot
live for themselves alone. What you achieve or don't
achieve, what you say, what you search for—all these things
gladden or displease them. And if you offend them—if you
make the mistake of disturbing them on their Olympus
—they swoop down upon you, bringing death—the death
which they know, a bitterness which lasts, which is felt
forever.
  }
  ◊ixion{We can still die.}
  ◊cloud{
No, Ixion. They will turn you into a kind of shadow,
a shade that wants to live but never dies.
  }
  ◊ixion{Have you seen them, these gods of yours?}
  ◊cloud{
I have seen them . . . Oh Ixion, you don't know
what you're asking.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I've seen some of them too, Nephele. I don't find them
so terrible.
  }
  ◊cloud{
I knew it. Your fate is sealed. Which one did you
see?
  }
  ◊ixion{
How could I tell? It was a young man. He was walking
barefoot through the forest. He passed by me, but didn't
◊; page-number 5
speak. Then he vanished before a cliff. For a long time
I stood there looking for him, too amazed to move. I wanted
to ask him who he was. He seemed to be a creature of flesh,
like you.
  }
  ◊cloud{Is he the only one you saw?}
  ◊ixion{
I saw him again in a dream, with the goddesses. I seemed
to be standing beside them, talking and laughing with them.
And they were telling me the same things that you're saying,
but without fear, without trembling like you. We talked
together of fate and death. We talked about Olympus. We
laughed at the ridiculous monsters—
  }
  ◊cloud{
O Ixion, Ixion, your fate is sealed! Now you know
what has changed up there above the mountains. And
you've changed too. And you think you're more than a man.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I tell you, Nephele, that you're like them. Why shouldn't
I admire them, at least in a dream?
  }
  ◊cloud{
Fool, you can't stop at dreams. You'll climb up to
them, aspire to them. You'll do something terrible. Then
that death of theirs will come.
  }
  ◊ixion{Tell me all the goddesses' names.}
  ◊cloud{
You see? Dreaming isn't enough for you now.
You believe in your dream as if it were real. I implore you,
Ixion, don't climb to the top. Think of the monsters and
how they were punished. The same thing will happen to
you.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I had another dream last night. You were in it too,
Nephele. We were fighting the Centaurs. I had a son whose
mother was one of the goddesses—I don't know which. And
he looked like that same young god who was walking
through the forest. He was stronger than me, Nephele. The
Centaurs ran away, and the mountain was ours. You were
laughing, Nephele. You see, even in my dreams, I can
accept my fate.
  }
◊; page-number 6
  ◊cloud{
Your fate is sealed. No one lifts his eyes to a goddess
with impunity.
  }
  ◊ixion{
Not even to the Goddess of the Oaks, the Lady of the
Peaks?
  }
  ◊cloud{
It doesn't matter which, Ixion. But don't be afraid.
I'll be with you till the end.

◊dialogue[#:id "dialogue-the-chimera"]{
  ◊dialogue-title{The Chimera}
  ◊dialogue-intro{
It was with high hearts that the youth of Greece set out
for the East in quest of glory and death. Here their
courage and daring took them through a sea of fabulous
atrocities, in which some of them failed to keep their
heads. There is no point in citing names. Besides, there
were more than seven such Crusades. It is Homer
himself who—in Book VI of the ◊roman{Iliad}—tells us of the
melancholy which consumed the killer of the Chimera
in his old age, and of his young grandson Sarpedon
who died under the walls of Troy.
  }
◊; page-number 8

  ◊interlocutors{Hippolochus, Sarpedon}

  ◊hippolochus{Ah, there you are, boy.}
  ◊sarpedon{
Hippolochus, I found your father. He won't hear of
coming home. You should see him. He's a terrible sight—
plodding through the countryside, covered with filth, oblivious
of the weather. He's an old beggar, Hippolochus.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What do the peasants say about him?}
  ◊sarpedon{
The Aleian plain is deserted, a wilderness, Uncle.
Reeds and swampland, nothing else. I asked about him in
the valley of the Xanthus, but they hadn't seen him for days.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What about him? What does he say?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He has no memory of home or us. Whenever he meets
somebody, he talks to him about the Solymi, of Glaucus,
Sisyphus, and the Chimera. When he saw me, he said, "if
I were your age, boy, I'd go drown myself." He doesn't
threaten the living. "Boy," he said to me, "you're just,
you're merciful. We're just and merciful men. If you want
to stay just and merciful, stop living."
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
Bellerophon bitter? Bellerophon grumbling? I can't
believe it.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
You should hear the terrible threats he makes. He
dares the gods to accept his challenge. Night and day he
keeps on walking. All his rancor, all his bitterness, is lavished
on the dead—or rather on the gods.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Glaucus and Sisyphus, you mean?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He says they were punished by treachery. Why wait
until they're old and feeble before ambushing them? "Bellerophon,"
◊; page-number 9
he says, "was just and merciful as long as the
blood coursed in his body. And now that he's old and
alone, why do the gods decide to abandon him?"
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
It's strange that should surprise him. And that he
should blame the gods for something which every living
thing must suffer. But he was always just. What do he and
those dead men have in common?
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
Listen, Hippolochus. When I saw those desperate
eyes of his, I too wondered if this was really Bellerophon
I was talking to. Something has happened to your father.
Not just old age. Not just misery and loneliness. Your
father is atoning for the death of the Chimera.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Are you mad, Sarpedon?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Your father accuses the gods of injustice because they
wanted him to kill the Chimera. Over and over again he
says, "From the day I stained myself with the monster's
blood, I haven't had a real life. I have looked for men to
fight, tamed the Amazons, slaughtered the Solymi. I ruled
over Lycia and I planted a great garden—but all this was
nothing. Where can I find another Chimera? Where is the
strength of the arms that killed her? Sisyphus and my
father Glaucus were just men, young men—then as they
grew old, the gods abandoned them both, let them become
wild animals and die. How can the man who met the
Chimera resign himself to death?" That's how your father
talks. The man who used to be Bellerophon.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
From Sisyphus, who chained the infant Thanatos,
to Glaucus who fed living men to his mares, our breed
has broken its bounds. But these are men of the past; they
belonged to an age of monsters. The Chimera was the last
monster they knew. Our land is just and merciful now.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
Are you sure, Hippolochus? You think that killing
the Chimera was enough? Our father—I can call him that
—should know. And yet he's as gloomy as a god—some
◊; page-number 10
white-haired old tramp of a god—and he roams through
fields and swamps talking to his dead.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What is he looking for?}
  ◊sarpedon{
The arm that killed the Chimera. He wants the pride
of Glaucus and Sisyphus, especially now that he, like them,
has reached the boundary of things, the limit, the end.
Their courage torments him. He knows a second Chimera
will never lie in wait for him among the rocks. And he
defies the gods.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
Sarpedon, I'm his son, but these are things I can't
understand. The earth is just a place now—why can't men
grow old in piece? In a young man, almost a boy like you,
Sarpedon, I can understand the tumult of the blood. But
only in a young man. Only for a just cause. Not revolt
against the gods.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
But he knows what it's like to be young, he knows
what old age is like. He's seen other days. He has looked
at the gods, as you and I look at each other now. He tells
of terrible things.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Why listen then?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Oh Hippolochus, who could help listening? Bellerophon
has seen things which don't often happen.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
I know, Sarpedon, I know. But that world is over.
When I was a child, he told me the same stories.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
But there's a difference—he wasn't talking with the
dead in those days. They were only stories then. But now
every destiny he meets becomes his own.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What did he tell you?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Things you already know. But what you can't know
is the coldness, the desperation in his eye, like the look of
a man who is no longer anything but who knows everything.
Stories of Lydia and Phrygia, old stories, without
justice, without mercy. You know the story of Silenus?
How a god challenged him to a contest on Mt. Celaenae,
◊; page-number 11
and then killed him by cutting him to pieces, like a butcher
slicing up a goat? And now a spring—of his own blood,
they say—wells up from the cave. Or the story of the mother
who was turned to stone, touched to weeping rock, because
it pleased a goddess to kill her children with arrows, one
by one? And the story of Arachne, who shuddered with
terror at Athena's hatred and became a spider? These are
things that happened. The gods did them.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
And the gods were right to do them. What do
they matter? There's no point in thinking of those things.
Of those destinies, nothing now remains.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
The spring remains, the mountain, the terror. The
dreams remain. Bellerophon can't take a step without stumbling
on a corpse, an old rancor, a pool of blood, surviving
from those days when it all happened, and things weren't
dreams. In those days his right arm had a weight in the
world, and he killed.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Then he was cruel too.}
  ◊sarpedon{
He was just, he was merciful. He killed the Chimera.
And now that he's old and exhausted, the gods abandon
him.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{And that's why he roams the countryside?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He's the son of Glaucus and Sisyphus. He fears the
caprices, the ferocity of the gods. He feels himself becoming
a wild animal, and he doesn't want to die. "Boy," he
says to me, "the mockery and treachery is this: first they
strip away your strength and then they despise you for being
less than a man. If you want to live, stop living . . ."
  }
  ◊hippolochus{If that's what he thinks, why doesn't he kill himself?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Nobody kills himself. Death is destiny. All you can
do is want it, Hippolochus.

Nothing happened in Thebes in which the blind

out in horror.

  ◊oedipus{
Old Tiresias, must I believe what they say here in
Thebes? That the gods blinded you out of jealousy?

  ◊tiresias{
If it's true that everything comes from the gods, then
you must believe it.
  }
  ◊oedipus{What do ◊em{you} say?}
  ◊tiresias{
That there's too much talk about the gods. Being blind
is a misfortune no different from being alive. It is my
experience that disasters strike in their own good time and
strike where they must.
  }
  ◊oedipus{In that case what do the gods do?}
  ◊tiresias{
The world is older than the gods. Before time was born,
the earth was already filling space. It bled, it felt pleasure;
the earth was the only god. In those days things themselves
had power. It was ◊em{things} that happened. Whereas now the
gods turn everything into words, illusions, threats. But the
gods can only make trouble, join things together or pull
them apart. Not touch them, not change them. They came
too late.
  }
  ◊oedipus{This is no way for a priest to be talking.}
  ◊tiresias{
If I didn't know that much, I wouldn't be a priest.
Take the case of a boy who goes swimming in the Asopus.
A morning in summer, say. The boy comes out of the water,
goes back in happily, dives, dives again. Then he gets
cramps and drowns. What do the gods have to do with
this? Should he attribute his death to the gods? Or the
pleasure he had? Neither one. Something has happened
◊; page-number 15
—something which is neither good nor evil, something
which has no name—the gods will give it a name later.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
And to give things names, to explain them, seems to
you a small matter, Tiresias?
  }
  ◊tiresias{
You're young, Oedipus, like the gods. And like them
you explain things by giving them names. You still don't
know that beneath the earth there is rock, and that the
bluest sky is the emptiest. For men like me, for the blind,
all things are a blow. A blow, Oedipus.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
And yet you've spent your life in touch with the gods.
You have meditated on the seasons, on human miseries and
pleasures. Men tell many stories about you, as they would
of a god. And one of them so strange, so improbable, that
it must have some kind of meaning—the kind of meaning
that the clouds have perhaps.
  }
  ◊tiresias{
I have lived a long time. I have lived so long that every
story I hear seems to be my own. What meaning do the
clouds have?
  }
  ◊oedipus{A presence within the emptiness . . .}
  ◊tiresias{But what is this story which you think has a meaning?}
  ◊oedipus{Have you always been the man you are now, Tiresias?}
  ◊tiresias{
Ah, I understand. The story about the snakes. When I
was a woman for seven years. Well, what do you make of
that story?
  }
  ◊oedipus{
It happened to you, and you know it did. But without
a god such things don't happen.
  }
  ◊tiresias{
You think so? On earth anything can happen. There is
nothing which hasn't happened before. In those days I had
feelings of sexual disgust. I felt that my spirit, my sanctity
as a priest, my character, were degraded by sex. When I
saw those two snakes taking their pleasure, making love on
the moss, I couldn't suppress my disgust, I touched them
with my stick. Shortly afterwards I became a woman—and
for years my pride was forced to submit. The things of the
world are rock, Oedipus.
  }
◊; page-number 16
  ◊oedipus{But is the woman's sex really so vile?}
  ◊tiresias{
Not at all. Nothing is vile, except to the gods. There are
irritations, feelings of disgust, and illusions which, when
they reach the rock, vanish. Here the rock was the force of
sex, its ubiquity and omnipresence under all forms and
changes. From man to woman, and vice versa (seven years
later I saw the two serpents again), what I refused to accept
with my spirit was done to me by violence or lust, and I,
proud man or humbled woman, let myself go as a woman
and was passive as a man. And I learned everything about
sex: I reached the point where as a man I looked for men,
and as a woman, looked for women.
  }
  ◊oedipus{You see? A god has taught you something.}
  ◊tiresias{
Above sex there is no god. It is the rock, I tell you.
Many gods are beasts, but the snake is the oldest of all the
gods. When a snake sinks down into the ground—there you
have the image of sex. Life and death are in it. What god
can incarnate and include so much?
  }
  ◊oedipus{You yourself. You said so.}
  ◊tiresias{
Tiresias is old, and he isn't a god. When he was young,
he was ignorant. Sex is ambiguous and always equivocal. It
is an end that seems an everything. Man succeeds in incarnating
it, in living inside it, like a good swimmer in the
water; but meanwhile he has grown old, he has reached
the rock. In the one idea, one illusion, remains: that the
other sex is satisfied. Well, don't believe it. For all of us
it is wasted effort. I know.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
It isn't easy to refute what you say. It's not for nothing
that your story begins with the snakes. But it also begins
with disgust, and sexual fatigue. What would you say to a
healthy man who swore to you that he had never felt disgust?
  }
  ◊tiresias{That he isn't a healthy man. He's still a boy.}
  ◊oedipus{
I have had encounters too, Tiresias, on the streets of
Thebes. And in one of them we talked about man—from
◊; page-number 17
infancy until death—and we too reached the rock. As of
that day I became husband and father, and king of Thebes.
For me in my life, there is nothing ambiguous or wasted.
  }
  ◊tiresias{
You aren't alone, Oedipus, in thinking that. But words
don't reach the rock. May the gods protect you! I too speak
to you, and I am old. Only the blind man knows the darkness.
It seems to me that I live outside time, that I have
lived forever, and I no longer believe in the days. In me too
there is something that feels pleasure and something that
bleeds.
  }
  ◊oedipus{
You were saying that this something was a god. Why,
good Tiresias, don't you try praying to it?
  }
  ◊tiresias{
We all pray to some god, but what happens has no
name. The boy who drowns on a summer morning—what
does he know of the gods? What does it help him to pray?
There is a great snake in every day of life, and it sinks down
and watches us. Have you ever asked yourself, Oedipus, why
the unhappy go blind as they grow old?

flesh, of fever and sighs: all this comes to you from the

That was long ago, Chiron. Now I live beneath the
earth or at the crossroads. Sometimes I see you and your
brothers bounding down from the hills, like great boulders,
vaulting over the ponds and the gorges, racing and calling.
Your hooves, your animal nature I can understand. But
you're more than that. Look at your arms and your chest,
like a man's chest. And that great human laugh of yours.
And the girl who was killed, and her love for the God. And
her friends who are weeping for her now—you're somehow
different things. Your own mother, surely, didn't a god
enjoy her once?
  }
  ◊chiron{
Yes, the world has changed since then. The old god
turned into a stallion to approach her. On the peak of the
mountain it was.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Yes, but answer me this. Coronis was a woman. She
walked through the vineyards and she played with the Bright
One till he killed her and burnt her body.
  }
  ◊chiron{
Hermes, have you ever looked up from Larissa and seen
Mount Olympus profiled against the sky after a night of
wind?
  }
  ◊hermes{Yes. And gone up there too, sometimes.}
  ◊chiron{
So did we once. We galloped up, we raced from ridge
to ridge.
  }
  ◊hermes{Why don't you go back?}
  ◊chiron{Coronis went back, Hermes.}
  ◊hermes{What do you mean by that?}
◊; page-number 22
  ◊chiron{
That mountain is death. That's what I meant. The new
masters live there. They're not like the masters in the old
days, Cronos or the Ancient One. They're not like us as
we used to be, when we bounded among things like the
things we were. In those days wild beasts and swamp brought
gods and men together. We were mountain and horse, plant
and cloud and running water, we were everything then,
everything on earth. Who could die in those days? What was
bestial then, if the beast was in us like the god?
  }
  ◊hermes{
You have girls, Chiron, and they are mortal women or
mares, as they please. Why complain? Here you centaurs
have the mountain, the plain, the seasons. There is everything
here you could ask for, even human houses, huts, and
villages down there by the mouth of the valley, and stables
and firesides where poor mortals tell tales about you and
are always glad to welcome you. Don't you think the world
is governed better by the new masters?
  }
  ◊chiron{
You're one of them and you take their side. But once
you were bull sperm and bestial rage, Hermes. Now you
lead the bloodless shades down to the world below. What
are men but shadows before their time? But I'm happy to
think that the child's mother leapt down on her own. If
she found nothing else, she found herself as she died.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Now I know why she died. She climbed the slopes of
the mountain, she was a woman and she gave the God such
love that she bore his child. The God has no pity, you say.
But do you really think Coronis left her animal desires
behind her in the swamps? Did she leave behind the shapeless
frenzy of the blood which spawned her?
  }
  ◊chiron{Of course she didn't. What then?}
  ◊hermes{
The new gods of Olympus are always smiling, but there's
one thing at which they do not smile. Believe me, I've seen
destiny. Whenever chaos spills over into the light, into
◊; page-number 23
their light, then they must strike down and destroy and
remake. That is why Coronis died.
  }
  ◊chiron{
But they can't remake Coronis. I was right when I told
you that Olympus is death.
  }
  ◊hermes{
But the Bright One loved her. If he were not a god he
would have mourned her. He snatched the child from her
body—he gives it to you joyfully. He knows that only you
can make a true man of him.
  }
  ◊chiron{
I have already told you what his fate will be in the
homes of men. He will be Asclepius, the lord of bodies, a
man-god. He will live among festering flesh and sighs. Men
will turn to him to escape their fate, to hold back by one
night, by a single instant, the pains of death. This little
child will walk between life and death, like you, Hermes,
who once were bull sperm and now are only the guide of
the shades. This is what the Olympians have in store for
mortal men.
  }
  ◊hermes{
But isn't it better for men to die like this than come
to that ancient damnation, to mate with beast or tree, to
become lowing bull or crawling snake, to become eternal
rock or weeping spring?
  }

Yes. So long as Olympus is heaven. But Olympus too
shall pass.

flecked by his blood now everywhere stars the valleys of the
Eurotas. It's spring, Thanatos, and this boy won't see it.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
Wherever an immortal has been, these flowers bloom.
But in the past there was at least some pretext, an attempt
to escape or an offense of some sort. They struggled against
The god or were guilty of some wickedness. It was that way
with Daphne and with Actaeon. But Hyacinth was only a
boy. He lived his life doing honor to his master. He played
with the god the way a child plays. He was excited, bewildered.
You know this, Eros.
  }
  ◊eros{
Mortals are already saying it was an accident. No one stops
to think that the Bright One rarely misses.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
All I saw was his frowning smile as he followed the
flight of the discus and watched it come down. He threw it
high into the sun, and Hyacinth looked up and raised his
hands and waited for it, dazzled. Why did this happen,
Eros? You surely must know.
  }
  ◊eros{
What can I say, Thanatos? I can't be moved to pity by a
god's whim. And you know as well as I do that when a god
◊; page-number 27
approaches a mortal, something cruel always happens. It
was you who spoke of Daphne and Actaeon.
  }
  ◊thanatos{But what happened this time?}
  ◊eros{
A whim, as I said. The Bright One wanted to play, he
came down among men and he saw Hyacinth. For six days
he lived in Amyclae, six days which changed Hyacinth's
whole life and reshaped the world for him. Finally, the lord
wanted to go away and Hyacinth looked at him, bewildered.
So the discus fell and struck him between the eyes.
  }
  ◊thanatos{Maybe Apollo didn't want him to cry.}
  ◊eros{
No, the Bright One doesn't know what crying is. We know
it, though, we young gods and daemons who were alive
when Olympus was still bare rock. We have seen many
things, we have seen even trees and stones weep. But the
lord is different. Six days, a life—they're all the same to
him. No one knew this better than Hyacinth.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
Did he really know these things? Didn't he perhaps
think of the god as a model, an older friend, a brother he
trusted and looked up to? I only saw him when he raised
his arms to play the game—there was nothing in his eyes
but trust and awe. No, Hyacinth didn't know who the
Bright One was.
  }
  ◊eros{
Perhaps, Thanatos. Perhaps he didn't even know about
Actaeon and Daphne. It's hard to tell where fear stops and
trust begins. But certainly he spent six days of intense
experience.
  }
  ◊thanatos{What do you think he really felt?}
  ◊eros{
What every young person feels. But this time the center
of his thoughts and actions was too much, too much for a
boy. He was with the stranger everywhere; wherever the
god was, he was—where men wrestled, in the rooms of the
palace, beside the Eurotas, talking to him, listening to him.
He listened to the god's stories about Delos and Delphi,
about Typho and Thessaly and the land of Hyperboreans.
◊; page-number 28
One thing is certain, the god said nothing of his
home on Olympus, of the other immortals, of divine things.
No, he talked about himself and his sister, about the Graces,
in the way people talk of ordinary life: wonderful, but ordinary.
Sometimes they listened together to a wandering poet
who was staying for the night.
  }
  ◊thanatos{Nothing wrong in all this.}
  ◊eros{
Nothing indeed, very reassuring. Hyacinth learned that
the lord of Delos, with those indescribable eyes and his
quiet way of speaking, had seen and experienced things
which might happen someday to him. The god spoke of
him too and of his fate. The everyday life of Amyclae was
an open book to him. He made plans for the future, he
treated Hyacinth like an equal, like someone of his own
age, and the names of Aglaia, Eurynome, and Auxo, distant
smiling women, young women, who had lived with the god
in strange intimacy—he spoke their names casually, calmly,
with an idle relish that made Hyacinth shiver. This was
how the boy lived, and felt. When he was with the god,
everything seemed easy and clear. He felt he could do anything.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
I've known other men too. Men of experience, wiser,
stronger than Hyacinth. And every one of them was destroyed
by this craving to do everything.
  }
  ◊eros{
But in Hyacinth it was only hope, a trembling hope of
becoming like the stranger. But the god refused the enthusiasm
he read in the boy's eyes—it was enough to arouse
it. What he saw in his eyes and his curly hair was the
beautiful purpled flower that was Hyacinth's fate. He paid
no attention to words or tears—he had come to see a
flower. And this flower had to be worthy of him, something
at once wonderful and ordinary, like the memory of the
Graces. So, tranquilly, he created the flower.
  }
  ◊thanatos{
We are ferocious things, we immortals. I wonder how
◊; page-number 29
long the Olympians will make destiny. They dare everything:
that may destroy them too.
  }
  ◊eros{
Who can tell? From the time of chaos, there has been
nothing but blood. Men's blood, blood of monsters, of gods.
We begin and we die in blood. How do you think you were
born, Thanatos?
  }
  ◊thanatos{
In order to be born, a thing must die: even men know
that. But the Olympians don't know it, they've forgotten it.
In a world that passes, they endure. They don't exist, they
◊em{are}. Their every whim is a fatal law. To express a flower, they
destroy a man.
  }
  ◊eros{
Yes, Thanatos. But shouldn't we take into account the
richness of feeling which Hyacinth experienced? That
tremulous hope in which he died was also his birth. He was
a boy, his mind was still fresh and unformed, still muffled
in the early mists of childhood, the son of Amyclas, the
unimportant king of an unimportant country—what would
he have been without the stranger from Delos?
  }
  ◊thanatos{A man among men, Eros.}
  ◊eros{
I know. And I know too that no one escapes his fate.
But it's not my way to be moved by a god's whim. Hyacinth
lived six days in the shadow of a light. He lacked
nothing—he knew perfect joy, he knew its rapid, bitter end.
Which is something that the Olympians and the immortals
do not know. What more could he ask, Thanatos?

the only thing you have is your own fate. Here it is, barely
dawn, and you're already on the move. That's because you
like to be awake when things are just coming out of the
dark, still untouched. You see that mountain? Latmos,

a kind of clearing opens before you in the forest? No,

passed through during the day: you saw a flower there, or a
kind of berry swaying in the wind—and this flower, this
berry, became something wild, something untouchable,
mortal, there among all the wild things? Do you know

fallen asleep one evening on Latmos, propped against a

caught within the circles of her eyes, in the space she filled,
the clearing, and the hill. She smiled at me, timidly. "Lady,"
I said to her, and she frowned, like a girl, like a shy, wild
thing, as though she understood that I was amazed, somehow
dismayed, to find myself calling her Lady. The dismay
I felt then was always between us.

touched my hair. There was something hesitant in the way

smile. I thought of all the names men call her by, and I
would have fallen to my knees but she held me up, as one
holds up a child, by putting her hand under my chin. Look
at me, I'm a grown man. And she was just a wild thing, a
slight awkward girl. Except for her eyes, those eyes of hers.
I felt like a small boy. "You must never wake again," she
said. "Don't try to follow me. I'll come to you again." And
she went off through the clearing.

I walked all over Latmos that night, until dawn. I followed
the moon everywhere, through the gorges and the
scrub, up to the peaks. I listened, listened, and all I could
hear was her voice, like the sound of sea water, a hoarse
voice, cold and maternal. Every rustle, every shadow stopped
me. I caught glimpses of wild animals, running. When the
light came—a livid, veiled light—I looked down on the
plain, on this road where we're walking now, and I knew
that my home was no longer among men. I was no longer
one of them. I was waiting for the night.

flesh turned stone. The shed blood, the savaged flesh, the
ravenous earth, the wilderness—all this I know. For her,

beasts are wilderness. Her caresses are like the caresses you

speech, into song. But fate is something quite different.

  ◊britomart{
Why, Sappho? Fate is joy, and when you sang your
song you were happy.
  }
  ◊sappho{
I was never happy, Britomart. Desire is not song. It
destroys, and burns, like a snake, like the wind.
  }
  ◊britomart{
But have you ever known mortal women who lived
peacefully in desire and tumult?
  }
  ◊sappho{
None. Wait, yes, perhaps . . . But not mortal women
like Sappho. You were still a mountain nymph, I wasn't yet
born, when a woman crossed this sea, a mortal woman, who
lived always in storm and strife. Perhaps she was in peace.
She killed, destroyed, blinded. She was like a goddess—
always herself, unchanging. Perhaps she didn't even have to
smile. She was lovely, no fool, and around her there was
nothing but fighting and death. Men fought and died for
her, Britomart, asking only for her name to be joined to
theirs for a moment, for her name to be given to their living
and dying. And they smiled for her. You know her—Helen,
the daughter of Leda.
  }
  ◊britomart{And she, was she happy?}
  ◊sappho{
At least she didn't run away, that much is certain. She
was sufficient unto herself. She didn't ask what her fate was.
Whoever had the will—and the strength—carried her off.
For ten years she followed a hero; they took her away from
him and married her to another man. He too lost her, countless
men fought for her across the seas. Then the second
man took her back and she lived with him, at peace. She
was buried, and in Hades she knew even more men. She lied
to no one, she smiled at no one. Perhaps she was happy.
  }
  ◊britomart{And you envy this woman?}
  ◊sappho{
I envy no one. I wanted to die. It's not enough for me
to be someone else, and if I can't be Sappho, I would sooner
be nothing.
  }
  ◊britomart{Then you accept your fate?}
  ◊sappho{I don't accept it. I ◊em{am} my fate. Nobody accepts his fate.}
  ◊britomart{Nobody except us. We who know how to smile.}
◊; page-number 43
  ◊sappho{
What's so hard about that? It's part of your fate. But
what does it mean?
  }
  ◊britomart{It means accepting, and accepting oneself.}
  ◊sappho{
Yes, but what does it ◊em{mean?} How can you accept a force
that seizes you and turns you into desire, into shuddering
desire that struggles over a body, a man's or a girl's, like
the foam between the rocks? And this body rejects you and
crushes you, and you fall and long to embrace the rock, to
accept it. Sometimes you are the rock yourself, and the foam
and the tumult are twisting at your feet. No
one is ever at peace. How can one accept all this?
  }
  ◊britomart{
You have to accept it. You tried to run away, Sappho,
and where are you now? A bit of frothing wave.
  }
  ◊sappho{
But don't you feel it, Britomart, this langour, this deep
tidal unrest? Everything here is torn and tormented endlessly.
Even dead things go on struggling.
  }
  ◊britomart{
You should know the sea, Sappho. You came from
an island.
  }
  ◊sappho{
Oh Britomart, even when I was a child it frightened
me. That ceaseless life is monotonous, sad . . . There are no
words for the weariness of it.
  }
  ◊britomart{
Once in my island I saw people coming and going.
There were women like you, Sappho, women who lived for
love. They never looked sad or tired to me.
  }
  ◊sappho{
I know, Britomart, I know. But did you follow them
on their journeys? There was one woman who hanged herself
from her own roof beam in a foreign land. And one
who woke up one morning on a rock, abandoned. And the
others, so many others, from all the islands and all the lands
who went down to the sea. Some were enslaved, some were
tortured, some killed their own children. There were some
who toiled night and day, and some who never touched
solid land again and became things, creatures of the sea.
  }
  ◊britomart{But Helen—she came out unscathed, you said?}
◊; page-number 44
  ◊sappho{
Sowing fire and slaughter. She smiled at no one, she lied
to no one. She was a woman worthy of the sea. But Britomart,
do you remember who was born over there?
  }
  ◊britomart{Who do you mean?}
  ◊sappho{
There is one island you've never seen. Every morning
when the sun rises, it touches this island first.
  }
  ◊britomart{Oh Sappho.}
  ◊sappho{
It was there she sprang from the sea, the goddess who
has no name, the tormented, restless one who smiles to
herself.
  }
  ◊britomart{But she doesn't suffer. She is a great goddess.}
  ◊sappho{
And everything that is torn and tortured in the sea is
her substance and her breath. Have you seen her, Britomart?}
  ◊britomart{
Oh Sappho, don't ask me. I'm only one of the little
nymphs.
  }
  ◊sappho{You must have seen her, then?}

In her presence we all run away. Don't speak of her,

Meleager's life was linked to a brand which his mother

Listen, Meleager. You're dead now. The flames, the

yourself. For you the things of the world—the morning,
the evening, this place or that—are nothing. Look around

I don't see anything. What does it matter? I'm an
ember again . . . What did you say about the places in the
world? Oh, Hermes, how lovely and various and sweet a
place the world must be to a god like you! You have a
god's eyes, Hermes. Whereas I was only Meleager, a hunter
and a son of hunters. I never left my native forests, I spent
my life by the hearth, and when I was born my fate was
already contained in the brand my mother pulled from the
fire. A few friends, the wild animals—this was all I ever
knew.

  ◊hermes{
Do you think any man in the world has ever known
anything else?
  }
  ◊meleager{
I don't know. But I've heard of lives that were lived
freely beyond the mountains and the rivers; tales of crossing
the sea, of archipelagoes, of encounters with monsters and
gods. Of men even stronger than I was, younger men,
marked with the sign of strange destinies.
  }
◊; page-number 47

Everyone of them had a mother, Meleager. And labors
to perform. And the same death awaited them all. They all
died of another's passion. None of them was his own master,
or knew anything else.
  }
  ◊meleager{
A mother . . . None of them had a mother like mine.
Nobody knows what it means to know that your life lies in
her hands, and to feel yourself blazing, and those eyes fixed
on the fire. Why did she draw the brand from the fire the
day I was born? Why didn't she let me crumble into ashes?
And I had to grow up, to become Meleager, to cry and
play, go hunting, to watch the winter and the seasons, to
be a man—but always knowing the other thing, carrying
that weight within me, daily seeing my fate in her eyes.
That's what hurts. An enemy is nothing.
  }
  ◊hermes{
You're strange, you mortals. The thing you already know
amazes you. That an enemy is nothing is obvious. He has
a mother too, like anybody else. So why can't you accept
the knowledge that your life lies in her hands?
  }
  ◊meleager{
Hermes, we hunters have an agreement. When we
climb the mountain, each man helps the other. Each holds
the other's life in his hands; he never betrays his friend.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Fool, a friend is always betrayed . . . But that's not it.
Your lives are forever contained in the burning brand, and
your mother draws you from the fire, and you live half
blazing. The passion of which you die is your mother's
passion, smouldering on in you. What are you but her flesh and blood?
  }
  ◊meleager{
It was her eyes, Hermes. You have to have seen those
eyes. Seen them from childhood on, to know them, live with
them, to feel them fixed on your every step, your every
action, for days, for years, and to know that they're getting
old, that they're dying, and to suffer what they suffer, to
hurt yourself by hurting them, to go in terror of offending
them. It's then that their staring at the fire, their watching
the brand as it burns, becomes unbearable.
  }
◊; page-number 48
  ◊hermes{
You know this too, and it surprises you, Meleager? The
fact that those eyes grow old and die means that in the
interval you become a man, and knowing that you offend
them, you go somewhere else in search of them—live eyes,
true eyes. And if you find them—and one always finds them,
Meleager—the person they belong to is again your mother.
And then you no longer know with whom you have to deal,
and you're almost happy. But there's one thing you can be
certain of—they know. Both of them alike, the old she and
the young ones. And no one can escape the fate that has
marked him from birth with the sign of the fire.
  }
  ◊meleager{Has anyone else had my fate, Hermes?}
  ◊hermes{
Everyone, Meleager. Everyone. The same death awaits
them all. They all die of another's passion. In every man's
flesh and blood, his mother rages. True, many men are
cowards, worse cowards than you.
  }
  ◊meleager{I was no coward, Hermes.}
  ◊hermes{
I speak to you as a shade, not as a mortal. So long as a
man doesn't know, he's brave.

I'm no coward now, not here, seeing what I see. I
know many things now. But I don't believe that she—the
young she—knew anything about those eyes.
  }

  ◊meleager{
Atalanta . . . Will she become a mother too? Could
she stare at the fire? Atalanta?
  }
  ◊hermes{
See if you can remember what she said to you, the night
when you killed the boar.
  }
  ◊meleager{
That night. The night of the pact. I haven't forgotten
that night, Hermes. Atalanta was furious because I'd let the
boar escape in the snow. She struck at me with her axe and
hit me on the shoulder. I barely felt the blow, but I burst
out, even angrier than she, "Get back to the house, Atalanta!
Go back with the women! This is no place for your silly
outbursts." And later that evening when the boar was
killed, Atalanta walked beside me, among the other hunters,
◊; page-number 49
and handed me the axe. She'd gone back alone to look for
it in the snow. That evening we made a pact that when we
went out hunting, one of us would take no weapons. That
way the other wouldn't be tempted by anger.
  }
  ◊hermes{And what did Atalanta say?}
  ◊meleager{
I remember clearly, Hermes. "Son of Althaea", she
said, "the boarskin will lie on our marriage-bed. It will be
like your blood-price—yours and mine." And she smiled, as
though asking for forgiveness.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Meleager, no mortal succeeds in thinking of his mother
as a girl. But don't you think the person who could say such
words would be capable of staring at the fire? It was old
Althaea who killed you, for a blood-price.
  }
  ◊meleager{
Hermes, all this is my fate. But surely there must have
been mortals who lived full lives, men whose lives didn't lie
in somebody else's hands . . .
  }
  ◊hermes{
Do you know of any, Meleager? They would be gods.
Oh, a few cowards may have succeeded in hiding, but they
too carried their mothers' blood, and sooner or later the
hatred, the passion, the rage blazed out in their hearts. On
some evening of life even they felt themselves blazing
again. Not all of you, true, have died of this. All of you,
when you know, lead the life of the dead. Believe me,
Meleager, you were lucky.
  }
  ◊meleager{
But not even to see my own children, barely to know
my own bed . . .

You've been lucky. Your children will not be born. Your
bed is empty. Your friends go hunting as they did before
you existed. You are a shade, a nothing.
  }
  ◊meleager{And Atalanta? What about her?}
  ◊hermes{
The house is empty as it used to be when night was
falling and you and the men came home late from hunting.
Atalanta, who drove you to revenge, is not dead. The two
women live together without speaking. They stare at the

hearth where your mother's brother was murdered and
where you became ashes. Maybe they don't even hate each
other. They know each other too well. Without a man,
women are nothing.

I recognize you, though. It takes more than a drop of
wine to down Patroclus. This evening I know that when all
is said and done there's no difference between us and the
common run of men. There is a worst for all of us. It's the
last thing to come and it stuffs your mouth like a fistful of
earth. Oh, it's all very well to be able to say, "I've seen this,
I've suffered that," but isn't it unjust that when the cruelest
thing of all comes, we can't even remember it?

Well, at least one of us will be able to remember for
the other. That way we'll fool destiny.

Everything I've done has been done with you. And as
you would do it.
  }

What I mean is, when we were always together, playing
and hunting, and the day was short but the years never
passed, did you know then what death was, your death? A
boy can kill himself, but he doesn't know what death is.
Then suddenly comes the day when you understand, death
is inside you, and from that moment on you're a grown man.

You fight and dice, you drink, you wish the nights away.
But have you ever seen a boy drunk?

remember. It seems to me that I've always drunk, that I
never knew what death was.

  ◊achilles{You're like a boy, Patroclus.}
  ◊patroclus{Ask your enemies about it, Achilles.}

I will. But for you death doesn't exist. And the man who
doesn't fear death is not a good soldier.

  ◊patroclus{And yet I'm with you tonight, drinking.}
  ◊achilles{
But haven't you any memories, Patroclus? Don't you
ever say: "I've done this, I've seen that," and asked yourself
what you've really done, what sort of live you've led,
what mark you have left on the world? What good is it to
live if we leave no memories behind us?
  }
  ◊patroclus{
When we were boys together, Achilles, we remembered
nothing. Just being together all day was enough.
  }
  ◊achilles{
Does anyone in Thessaly still remember those days,
I wonder? And when this war is over and our comrades go
home, who will walk the streets we used to walk, who will
know that we were once boys there too—two boys no different
from any others there now? Do the boys who are
growing up there know what's waiting for them?

  ◊patroclus{
Yes, but haven't we seen a good many already,
Achilles?

  ◊achilles{
No, Patroclus, not so many! The day will come when
we are corpses. When our mouths will be stuffed with a
fistful of earth. And we won't even know what we've seen.
  }
  ◊patroclus{Why think of these things?}
  ◊achilles{
How not think of them? A boy's like an immortal, he
looks and laughs. He doesn't know what things cost. He
doesn't know the sweat and the bitterness. His fighting is

a game. He throws himself down on the ground and plays
dead, then he laughs and goes on with the game.

But we have other games. Women and plunder. The
enemy. And our drinking together at night. Achilles, when
are we going back to the fighting?

We're going back, you can be sure of that. A destiny
awaits us. When you see ships on fire, that will be the
moment.

Does waiting frighten you? Haven't you seen worse
than this?

it off. Why not tomorrow?

There's no hurry, Patroclus. Let the gods say Tomorrow.
It's only for them that what has been will be.

But whether or not we can say, I've seen worse than
this—that depends on us. To the very end. So drink,
Achilles. Drink to the spear, drink to the shield. What has
been will be again. We'll go back to the fighting, the danger.

No more than an old servant or a beggar. They've been
young too.

You're rich, Achilles, and for you wealth is just a rag
to be thrown away. It's only a man like you who can compare
himself to a beggar. You, the man who stormed the
citadel of Tenedos and tore the girdle of the Amazon and
fought with bears on the hills. What other child was tempered
by his mother on the fire? You are sword and spear,
Achilles.

As the shadow after the cloud. As Pirithous with

Theseus. One day, Achilles, perhaps you too will come down
to Hades, to rescue me.

It was better when there was no Hades. When we wandered
through the forests and by the streams and washed
the sweat off our bodies, when we were boys . . . Every
gesture, then, every motion, was a game. We were memory
and no one knew it. Were we brave? I don't know, it doesn't
matter. I know that on the centaur's mountain it was summer,
it was winter, it was all of life. We were immortal.

And then the worst came. Danger came, and death.
And we left for Troy.

There's no escaping fate. I never saw my son. Even
Deidamia is dead. Oh why did I ever leave the island with
the women?

Your memories would have been poor then, Achilles.
Better to suffer than never to have lived.

But how could I tell that life was to be like this? Oh
Patroclus, this is what it is. We had to see the worst.
  }
  ◊patroclus{Tomorrow I'm going out to the fighting. With you.}
  ◊achilles{No, my day hasn't yet come.}
  ◊patroclus{
Then I'll go alone. And to put you to shame, I'll take
your spear.

  ◊achilles{
I wasn't born when they cut down the ash to make it.
I wonder if the clearing in the woods is still there.

Come and fight, and you'll see that your spear is
worthy of you. An enemy for every stump.

I'll take your greaves and your shield. It will be like

doing something more tomorrow. Even the wicked can hope
for that. But suspicion followed me everywhere, vague
rumors, threats. At first it was only an oracle, an ill-omened
word, and I hoped to escape. I lived all those years like a
fugitive, looking behind me. I dared believe only in my own
thoughts, in the instants of truce, in the unforeseen awakenings.
It was like an ambush. I was always on the alert. And
I didn't escape. It was precisely at that instant that my fate

used to talk about you in the streets of Thebes. And there

saw the sea and went to Delphi to consult the oracle—all
this to achieve the same fate as you, Oedipus. Your fate was
so exceptional, you see, that it altered other people's. But

done the same job every day, had the usual children, the
usual festivals, and dies at the same age as his father of

something uniquely human, in walking the open road. Tortuous,
lonely, it is an image of the sorrow that eats us away.
A sorrow which is almost relief, like rain after heat: so still,
so tranquil that it seems as though it welled up from things,
from the depth of the heart. This fatigue, this peace, after
all the uproar of our destiny—they're perhaps the only
things that are truly our own.

There was a time when we didn't exist, Oedipus. That
means that even the deepest desires of our heart, our blood,
our moments of awakening, have sprung from nothing. Even
your desire to escape destiny is perhaps destiny. It isn't we
who made our own blood. It's enough to feel it and live
like free men, as the oracle bids us.

Yes, as long as a man is still searching. You had the
luck never to reach your goal. But the day comes when you

that you were born up there. And everything crumbles.

you really want to be king?

In world history, the era named after the Titans was
peopled with men and monsters and with gods not

you free.

I know, Heracles. I knew when you were still only
a baby in swaddling clothes, I knew before you were even
born. But I'm like someone who has suffered a great deal

comes for him to go, he can hardly bring himself to leave
the place where he's suffered so much.

I cannot die. For that matter, you won't die either, Heracles.

them?

  ◊prometheus{
Oh Heracles, there's a wisdom more ancient than
theirs. The world is old, older than this rock. Even they
know that. Everything has a destiny. But the gods are young,
almost as young as you are.

  ◊heracles{Aren't you a god too?}

I will be someday. So destiny wills. But once I was
a Titan and I lived in a world without gods. Yes, there was
such a world. Can you imagine it, Heracles?

Every man has his rock—that is why I love men.
It's only the gods who don't yet know the rock. They
don't know how to laugh or cry. They smile at destiny.

Oh Heracles, the victor is always a god. So long as
the Titan-man struggles and endures, he can laugh and cry.
And if they nail you here, or you climb your mountain, that

is the victory that fate allows you. We should be grateful
for this. What is a victory but pity turned gesture, saving
others at your own expense? Everyone works for others,
under the law of destiny. Even I, Heracles, if I am freed
today, owe it to someone.
  }
  ◊heracles{
I've had harder tasks than this, Prometheus. Besides,
I haven't freed you yet.

I'm not talking about you, Heracles. You're brave
and compassionate. But you've already done your job.

You wouldn't be a man if you knew what was destined.
But you live in a world of gods, and the gods have
taken this knowledge from you too. You know nothing and
you've already done everything. Remember the centaur.
  }
  ◊heracles{The beast-man I killed this morning?}
  ◊prometheus{
Monsters can't be killed. Not even the gods can
do that. A day will come when you'll think you've killed a
second monster, far less human than the first, and all you'll
have done is prepare your rock. Do you know who you
struck down this morning?
  }
  ◊heracles{A centaur.}
  ◊prometheus{
It was Chiron you killed, the good, compassionate
Chiron, friend of Titans and men.
  }
  ◊heracles{Oh Prometheus . . .}
  ◊prometheus{
Don't be troubled, Heracles. Our fates are fused.
By the world's law, no one goes free unless another's blood
is shed for him. The same will happen with you, on Mt.
Oeta. And Chiron knew this.
  }
  ◊heracles{You mean he sacrificed himself?}
  ◊prometheus{
What else? Just as once I knew that the theft of
fire would mean my rock.

  ◊heracles{
Let me untie you, Prometheus. Then you can tell me
all about Chiron and Mt. Oeta.
  }
  ◊prometheus{
I'm free already. I could be released only if someone
◊; page-number 67
took my place. Chiron let himself be struck down by you;
and you were sent by fate. But in this world born of chaos
there is a law of justice. Pity, fear, and courage are only
its instruments. Whatever is done must one day recur. The
blood which you have shed, which you will shed will drive
you up to Oeta to die your own death there. It will be the
blood of the monsters which you now live to destroy. And
the pyre you mount will burn with the fire I stole.
  }
  ◊heracles{But you told me I couldn't die.}
  ◊prometheus{
Death entered this world with the gods. You mortals
fear death because you know that the gods, by being gods,
are immortal. But everyone has the death he deserves. Their
day will come too.
  }
  ◊heracles{What do you mean, Prometheus?}
  ◊prometheus{
Not everything can be explained. But always remember
that monsters do not die. What dies is the fear they
inspire. So with the gods: when men no longer fear them,
they will vanish.
  }
  ◊heracles{And will the Titans return then?}
  ◊prometheus{
Rocks and forests don't return. They are. What
has been will be.
  }

And yet you Titans were changed by the gods. You too,
Prometheus.

Titan is a name, nothing more. Understand me,
Heracles. The world has its seasons, like the fields, like the
earth. Winter returns, summer returns. How can we say
that the forest dies, or remains the same? Before long, men
will be the Titans.

  ◊orpheus{
This is how it happened. We were climbing the path
through the Forest of Shadows. Cocytus, the Styx, Charon's
skiff, and the screams of the damned were far behind us.
Reflected on the leaves I could just make out the first
glimmer of the sky. But I was still down there in Hades,
and that chill was still with me. I was thinking that someday
I would have to go back down, that what has been will be
again. I was thinking of my life with her, how it had been
before; someday it would have to finish again. What has
been, will be. I was thinking of that cold, of that emptiness
I had passed through and which she was carrying with her
in her bones, in her marrow, her blood. Was it worth the
anguish of coming back to life? I was thinking of this, when
I saw the first glimmer of the light. Then I said, "Let's
finish it once and for all." And I turned around. Eurydice
disappeared like a snuffed candle. All I heard was a faint
squeal, like a mouse skittering to its hole.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
A strange story, Orpheus. I can barely believe it.
People here used to say that you were loved by the gods
and the Muses. And like me, many Bacchantes follow you
because they know you're in love and unhappy. You were
so much in love that you alone among men have gone
through the gates of nothingness. No, I don't believe you,
Orpheus. It isn't your fault if destiny misled you.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Destiny has nothing to do with it. My destiny does not
mislead. It's absurd that after such a journey, after looking
◊; page-number 71
nothingness in the face, I should have turned around on a
sudden impulse, or by mistake.
  }
  ◊bacchante{Here they say you did it for love.}
  ◊orpheus{Nobody loves the dead.}
  ◊bacchante{
And yet you mourned her, wandering the mountains
and hills—searching for her, calling her. You went down
into Hades. Wasn't that love?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
You claim to see things like a man. Then you must
know that there's nothing a man can do with death. The
Eurydice I mourned was a season of life. I was looking down
there for something very different from my love. I was looking
for a past which Eurydice knows nothing of. I understood
this among the dead while I was singing my song. I
saw the shades stiffen and stare vacantly, heard the lamentation
stop. Persephone hid her face, and Hades himself, the
inscrutable lord of the shadows, leaned forward like a mortal
man and listened. I understood that the dead are nothing.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Grief has distracted your mind, Orpheus. Who
wouldn't want his past again? Eurydice was almost reborn.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Reborn for what? Only to die all over again, Bacchante.
To carry in her blood the horror of Hades and to tremble
at my side night and day. You don't know what nothingness
is.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Through your singing you had recovered the past.
But instead you rejected it and destroyed it. No, I can't
believe it.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Listen, Bacchante. Only in my song was the past real.
No sooner had I started on the way back than that past
vanished away, became memory, tasted of death. When I
saw the first flicker of light, I jumped for joy like a child,
barely believing it. It was joy for myself, selfish joy, joy for
the world of the living. The season I had been searching
for was there in that glimmer of light. The woman following
me no longer mattered. My past was that first glimmer of light,
it was the song, and the morning. And I turned around.
  }
◊; page-number 72
  ◊bacchante{
I can't believe it, Orpheus. How could you have endured
such a loss? Those who saw your face when you came
back were frightened. For you Eurydice was a season of life.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Nonsense. When Eurydice died, she became something
else. The Orpheus who went down into Hades was no longer
either husband or widower. The grief I felt at the same time was
like the grief of a child—you smile when you remember it.
That season is over. When I wept, I was no longer looking
for her, but for myself. For a fate, if you like. I was listening
to myself.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Many of us follow you because we believe in your
sorrow. Have you misled us then?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Oh Bacchante, Bacchante, why won't you understand?
My destiny does not mislead. I was looking for myself. What
else can one look for?
  }
  ◊bacchante{
We're simple people, Orpheus. Here we believe in
love and death; we laugh and feel sorrow with others. Our
most joyful festivals are those in which blood flows. The
women of Thrace are not afraid of things like this.

If life is all you know, everything is beautiful. But once
you've been among the dead . . . Believe me, you can't say
that.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You weren't like this once. You didn't use to talk
about nothingness. It's the encounter with death that makes
us like gods. It was you yourself who taught us that ecstasy
confounds life and death and makes us more than human
. . . You've seen the festival.

But I didn't find you there. I wanted something very
different. Something I found when I returned to the light.

There was a time when you sang of Eurydice on the
mountains—
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Time passes, Bacchante. The mountains are still there,
Eurydice isn't. These things have a name, and their name
is man. Invoking the gods of your rite is no help here.
  }
  ◊bacchante{You once invoked them too.}
  ◊orpheus{
In life a man does everything. Believes everything. He
even believes that his own blood runs in the veins of others.
Or that what has been can be undone. He believes his ecstasy
can shatter fate. I know all this, and it is nothing.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You don't know what to make of death, Orpheus,
and yet death is your only thought. There was a time when
our rite made us immortal.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Go on then, enjoy your rite. Only your ignorance makes
it possible. Everyone must descend at least once into his
own private hell. The ritual of my destiny ended in Hades,
when I sang, as only I have the right to sing, of death and
life.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You say your destiny doesn't mislead. What do you
mean?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
I mean that it's inside you, the fact of your being,
deeper than blood, beyond all ecstasy. No god can touch it.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
Perhaps, Orpheus. But we aren't looking for Eurydice.
So why tell us that we all must go down to hell?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Every time you invoke a god, you meet death. And you
go down to Hades to bring something back, to violate a
destiny. You don't defeat the darkness, and you lose the
light. You're torn apart, like a man possessed.
  }
  ◊bacchante{
You're evil, Orpheus . . . You mean you lost the
light?
  }
  ◊orpheus{
I was almost lost, and then I sang. By comprehension
I found myself.
  }
◊; page-number 74
  ◊bacchante{
If that's the price, is it worth it? There's a simpler
way, the way of ignorance and joy. The god is like a lord,
midway between life and death. You yield to his ecstasy,
you're torn to pieces and you tear others to pieces. And
we're reborn, Orpheus, every time, and we waken—like you
when you returned to the light.
  }
  ◊orpheus{
Don't talk of daylight, of waking. Few men know.
Women like you don't know what it is.

Maybe this is why the women of Thrace follow you.
For them you're like the god. You came down from the
mountains. You sing songs of love and death . . .

you'll be like a man.

dead, that he too lived brutally and cruelly—and this was

animal.

we'd howl and tear out the throat of anyone who got in our
way. The only thing that saves us is waking up and finding
we have hands and a mouth and human speech. But for
him there was no escape—he left the eyes and the homes of
men behind him forever. Now that he's dead, let him lie in
peace.

Peace wasn't what he wanted. Peace for him was
curling up among the rocks and howling at the moon. I've
lived in the woods long enough to know that wild things
have no terror of the holy: animals look at heaven only
to yawn, the trees rustle their leaves. And in one respect,
they're like gods: they have no sense of guilt.

  ◊hunter1{
I wouldn't know whether it's fine or not, but I do
know this—I never heard of a plant or an animal that
wanted to turn into a human being. Whereas these woods
are full of men and women who were touched by divinity
and became bush or bird or wolf. No matter how evil they
were or what crimes they committed, their hands were
cleansed of blood, they were freed from guilt and hope,
they forgot they were humans. Isn't that what it is to be a
god?
  }
  ◊hunter2{
A punishment is a punishment. But it removes the
sinner's hopes and fears, and makes destiny of his remorse.
Even if the animal has no memory of the past and lives
solely for his prey, for death, the thing he was remains.
Over there on the hill old Callisto lies buried. Who remembers
what her crime was now? The lords of the sky punished
her severely. Think of it. A beautiful woman, they say she
was, turned into a growling, sobbing bear. She was afraid
of the dark and wanted to go home. There's an animal that
had no peace. Her son came and killed her with his lance,
and the gods didn't move a finger. Some say the gods repented
later and turned her into a tangle of stars. But the
body remained, and that was buried.
  }
  ◊hunter1{
And so? I know the old stories too. It wasn't the
gods' fault if Callisto didn't know how to accept her fate.
It's like someone who wears mourning to a feast, or gets
drunk at a funeral. If I were a wolf, I'd be a wolf even in
my sleep.
  }
  ◊hunter2{
Because you don't know the way of the blood. The
gods add nothing, take nothing away. All they do is touch
you lightly—and nail you where you are. What once was
wish or choice, you find is fate. That means becoming a
wolf. But something of you remains, the you who ran from
the house, the old Lycaon in us all.

he couldn't defend himself. While he was dying there on
the rocks, unable to speak a word, I thought of those poor
old beggars and how they stop short just outside the gate
while the dogs strain at their leashes trying to get at them.
This is something we've seen even here. Admitted, he lived
like a wolf. But when he died and looked at us, he knew he
was a man. His eyes said he was.

down. Do you think it matters to him whether he rots underground,
like a man?

There's a peace beyond death. A common lot. It
matters to the living, it matters to the wolf in us all. It was

ruddy as fresh-turned earth, and your eyes are like flowers.
You'll fertilize these fields all right.

  ◊heracles{Who taught you this practice of yours?}
  ◊lityerses{
This is the way it's always been. If a man doesn't feed
the earth, why should the earth feed him?
  }
  ◊heracles{
This year's crop looks like a splendid one. The wheat
stands as high as the reaper's shoulders. Who was the
victim?
  }
  ◊lityerses{
We couldn't get any foreigners last year. So we had to
make do with an old slave and a goat. It was flabby blood.
The earth barely felt it. Look how thin the ears are. Before
cutting up the body, we have to sweat him in the sun till
he comes to a lather. And that's why we're going to put you
to work, reaping and bringing in the sheaves until you're
running with a sweat. And then, at the last minute, when your
blood is boiling pure and foaming like a living thing—that's
◊; page-number 83
the moment when we'll slit your throat. Yessir. You're a
strong young man.
  }
  ◊heracles{Your gods approve of this practice?}
  ◊lityerses{
Above this field there are no gods. There is only the
earth, the Mother, the Cave. She's always waiting, and she
comes to life when the blood streams down to her. Tonight
you'll go down to her cave, stranger.
  }
  ◊heracles{Don't any of you Phrygians ever visit the cave?}
  ◊lityerses{
We leave it when we're born—there's no hurry about
going back.
  }
  ◊heracles{
I think I understand. They you manure your gods with
human blood?
  }
  ◊lityerses{
Not the gods, stranger. The earth is our god. Don't
you worship the earth where you live?
  }
  ◊heracles{
Our gods aren't underground. They rule the sea and
the earth, the forest and the cloud, as a shepherd keeps his
flock or a master governs his servants. They live apart, on
the mountains, like the thoughts you see in a man's eye
when he speaks to you, or like the clouds in the sky. They
don't demand blood.
  }
  ◊lityerses{
Stranger, I don't understand. For us the cloud and the
mountain and the cave all have the same name, they're all
one. The blood the Mother has given us we give back to
her in our sweat and death and dung. You must come from
a long way off, stranger. Those gods of yours don't make
sense.
  }
  ◊heracles{
Their breed is immortal. They have conquered the
forest, and the earth and its monsters. As for men like you
who feed the earth with blood, they have driven them down
to the cave.
  }
  ◊lityerses{
I'm not saying your gods don't know their business.
They must have fed the earth with a lot of blood too. Besides,
no famished earth ever brought forth a man like you.
  }
  ◊heracles{Lityerses, shall we start reaping?}
◊; page-number 84
  ◊lityerses{
You're a strange fellow. You know, this is the first
time anyone ever said that to me. Aren't you afraid of dying
among the windrows? I suppose you think you'll run off
through the furrows like a squirrel or a quail?
  }
  ◊heracles{
If I understand you, this isn't dying; it's a return to the
mother, a guest's gift of friendship. All these peasants
sweating in the fields will hail the man who gives his blood
for them. They'll offer him songs and prayers. It's a great
honor.
  }
  ◊lityerses{
Say, stranger, thanks. That slave we killed last year
didn't talk like that, I can tell you! He was an old man, on
his last legs, but we had to tie him up with withies anyway.
Even so, he thrashed about trying to dodge the sickles for
so long that he'd lost all his blood before he fell.
  }
  ◊heracles{
That won't happen this time, Lityerses. But when
you've killed the poor man, what do you do with him?
  }
  ◊lityerses{
His flesh is hacked off while he's still alive. And then
we scatter the pieces over the fields to waken the Mother
and touch her into life. We wrap the head in sheaves and
flowers, then we sing and dance and throw it into the
Meander. She's cloud and running water too.
  }
  ◊heracles{
You're a wise man, Lityerses, and I can see why you're
king of the fields at Celaenae. But how about Pessinus? Are
there killings there too?
  }
  ◊lityerses{
They kill people everywhere, stranger. Our wheat can
only grow from earth which has been touched to life. The
earth is a living thing. She too must be fed.
  }
  ◊heracles{
But why do you always kill strangers? Surely the earth,
the cave from which you came, would sooner take back its
own, wouldn't it? Don't you like the bread and wine from
your own fields best?
  }
  ◊lityerses{
You know, I like you, stranger. You might almost be
one of us. But ask yourself why we endure the sweat and
the toil of working these fields. To live—right? Well then,
◊; page-number 85
it's only fair that we stay alive and enjoy the harvest, and
let the other people die. But I suppose you wouldn't know.
You're no peasant.
  }
  ◊heracles{
But wouldn't it be even better to find a way of putting
an end to the killings and letting everyone, strangers and
your own people alike, enjoy the harvest? Wouldn't it be
better to have one last killing which of itself would make
the earth and the clouds and the strength of the sun forever
fruitful?
  }
  ◊lityerses{
You're no countryman, anyone can see that. Why, you
don't even know that every solstice the earth begins anew,
and the year in its course wears everything away.
  }
  ◊heracles{
But there must be someone who's been nourished,
from generation to generation, by the sap of every season,
someone so rich and strong and full-blooded that he could
at one stroke renew the earth forever?
  }
  ◊lityerses{
You make me laugh, stranger. You know, you might
almost be talking about me. My family's the only one in
Celaenae that's been here for generations. I'm the king here,
and you know it.
  }
  ◊heracles{
Yes, you're the man I had in mind, Lityerses. So let's
start reaping. I came from Greece for this deed of blood.
We'll reap, Lityerses, and tonight you'll go down to the
cave.
  }
  ◊lityerses{You want to kill me? On my own field?}
  ◊heracles{I want to fight you. To the death.}

Because it's a holiday, son. Rain would put the bonfires

  ◊son{
And it's never rained on the bonfires while they were still
burning?
  }
  ◊father{
Who knows, son. They were lighting these bonfires long
before you or I were born. Same night every year. Come
to think of it, there ◊em{was} one time when it did rain on the
bonfire. Or so they say.
  }
  ◊son{It really did?}
  ◊father{
Yes, but it was a long time ago. People were better than
they are now, and even kings' sons were shepherds in those
days. This whole country looked like a threshing floor then,
threshed neat and clean, and it did what king Athamas told
it to do. People worked and lived their lives, they didn't
have to hide the young goats from the landowners. One
year, they say, the August dog days brought a spell of heat
so bad that the fields and the wells dried up and the people
were dying. They lit the bonfires, but it didn't do a bit of
good. So Athamas took counsel. But he was an old man,
and he'd married a young wife not so long back. She ordered
him around, the way those young women do. And
she kept telling him that this was a time for strong measures
if he didn't want to lose credit. I suppose you want to know
why they didn't pray and sprinkle water? Well, they did.
Why didn't they sacrifice a calf and a bull, lots of bulls?
Well, they did. And what happened? Nothing, that's what.
  }
  ◊following{
So they had to sacrifice his sons. Not his sons by her.
◊; page-number 90
No sir. He didn't have any sons by her. No, these were two
grown-up sons by his first wife—they worked out in the
fields all day long. Well, Athamas, the crazy fool, decided
to do it. Go get them, he said. But the kings' sons aren't so
stupid, you know. So they took off. Then what? Well, as
soon as some god heard what was happening, he sent the
rain clouds down. And the minute the boys took off, those
clouds disappeared. The next thing was that witch of a wife
of his was saying, "You see! I told you so. The clouds were
piling up already. We've got to kill some one." Well, she
kept on like this till the people decided to take Athamas
and burn him alive. They made the bonfire and lit it. They
brought in Athamas, tied up and covered with flowers like
a sacred ox. But suddenly, just when they were about to
throw him on to the fire, the sky turned black. Thunder and
lightning, and then the rain came flooding down. The harvest
was saved. The rain put out the fire, and what do you
think that old fool Athamas does? He forgives them all,
even his wife. Look out for women, son. It's easier to tell a
snake from his missus than know what's going on int a
woman's mind.
  }
  ◊son{But what happened to the king's sons?}
  ◊father{
Never heard of again. But two young fellows like that
will always make out.
  }
  ◊son{
But if men were good in those days, dad, why did they
want to burn the two boys?
  }
  ◊father{
Because it was August, silly. You don't know what the
real dog days are like. But I know them, and your grandfather
knew them. Compared to them, winter's nothing.
Winter's rough, sure, but you always know it's doing the
crops good. Not the dog days. The dog days mean drought.
Everything dies, and thirst and hunger do things to a man.
A man who hasn't eaten wants to pick a fight. And don't
forget that in those days people got along with each other.
◊; page-number 91
Everyone had his bit of land, they were decent, prosperous
people. Then suddenly the wells go dry, the wheat burns up,
people go hungry and thirsty. Before long they turn into
wild animals.
  }
  ◊son{Then they must have been bad.}
  ◊father{
No worse than we are. The dog days are our masters
now, and there's no rain can set us free from ◊em{them.}
  }
  ◊son{
I don't like these bonfires. Not now. What good do they
do the gods? Is it true there were people burnt on them
once?
  }
  ◊father{
Oh, not just anyone. They burnt crippled children,
loafers, idiots. Useless people, or people who stole wheat.
And that was enough for the gods. Good or bad, it always
rained.
  }
  ◊son{
What did the gods like about it? I mean, if it rained anyway.
And what about Athamas? Didn't the gods put out
the fire?
  }
  ◊father{
Look, the gods are our masters. They're like the landowners—they're
our masters too. You think they'd let one
of their kind burn? Not them. They help each other
out. But with us, it's different. Nobody helps us. Rain or
shine, what do the gods care? We're lighting the bonfires
tonight. Brings on the rain, they say. But do the landowners
care? Ever seen one of them come down to the fields?
  }
  ◊son{No, never.}
  ◊father{
Figure it out for yourself. Let's suppose a bonfire can
make it rain, and burning some useless loafer can save the
harvest. Well, how many owners' houses would you have to
burn, how many owners would you have to kill in the streets
to bring some justice back to the world and make us our
own masters again?
  }
  ◊son{What about the gods?}
  ◊father{What have the gods got to do with it?}
  ◊son{
Didn't you say the gods and the owners are in it together?
They're masters.
  }
◊; page-number 92
  ◊father{
Yes, they're the masters. Well, we'll give them their goat.
What else can we do? We'll burn the useless loafers, the
thieves who steal our wheat! We'll make a real bonfire.
  }
  ◊son{I wish it was morning, dad. These gods frighten me.}
  ◊father{
You're right, son. That's why we have to try and get the
gods on our side. At your age it would be a bad thing to
forget what the gods are like.
  }
  ◊son{
I want to forget. The gods aren't just. Why do they have to
burn people alive?
  }
  ◊father{
They wouldn't be gods if they didn't. They don't have
to work—how else do you expect them to spend their time?
In the days before there were landowners and there was
still some justice in the world, someone had to be killed
every once in a while to keep the gods happy. That's the
way they are. But nowadays they don't need that sort of
thing any more. There's so many of us being miserable that
the gods are happy just sitting there, watching us. That
satisfies ◊em{them.}
  }
  ◊son{So ◊em{they're} the useless loafers!}
  ◊father{You're right, son. Useless loafers is just what they are.}
  ◊son{
What about the crippled children? What did they do when
they were burned? Did they scream?
  }
  ◊father{
It's no the screaming that matters, son, it's who does the
screaming. Crippled people or criminals—they're both useless.
But when a man with children of his own sees a lot
of loafers getting fat at his expense, that's what hurts. That's
the injustice.
  }
  ◊son{
It makes me shiver when I think of the bonfires they had
in the old days. Look down there. Bonfires burning everywhere.
  }
  ◊father{
It wasn't the way you think, son. There wasn't a boy
burned on every bonfire. They did it then as we do now
with the goats. Figure it out for yourself. If one goat makes
it rain, there's rain enough for everybody. One man was
enough for a whole mountainside, a whole village.
  }
◊; page-number 93
  ◊son{
I don't want to think about it. I won't. If that's the way
we treated each other, then the landowners have every
right to eat us alive. The gods are right to watch us suffer.
We're evil, we're all evil.
  }
  ◊father{
Wet down the branches, son, and sprinkle on the water.
You're too young to understand. Who are you to be talking
about what's right and wrong? No, stupid, over there,
towards the sea.

Peace and quiet, Odysseus. Have you ever wondered

It isn't that, Odysseus. The air, even the air of this
desert island, which quivers now with the dull roar of the
sea and the cries of the birds, is too empty. In this emptiness
there is nothing to be regretted, nothing at all. But

like the trace of an old tension and presence, long since
vanished?

It's a silence, I tell you. Something remote, almost dead.
Something which has been and which will never be again,
from the old world of the gods when anything I did was
destiny. I had terrible names, Odysseus. The earth and sea
obeyed me. Then I grew tired. Time passed. I lost the will
to move. A few of us resisted the new gods; I let my names
sink deep into time. Everything changed and everything
remained the same; it wasn't worth the trouble to contest
destiny with the new gods. From that time on I knew my

If anything, this country is more vivid than my own. In

untouched by the days. What does this land of Hesperia

Nothing different from any other country anywhere. We

But I have lived in places you prefer to this. I've gone
hunting on Didymus; I've run along the beaches of Troezen,
places as poor and as wild as myself. But this inhuman silence,

this life beyond life—I've never breathed anything like this
before. What makes it so lonely here?

Lonely, child? A place where no man has ever set foot will
always be a land of the dead. From your seas and islands
other men will come, and they will think they are entering
Hades. And there are other countries even farther away . . .
  }
  ◊virbius{
Other lakes, other mornings like these. The water is
bluer than the plums among the leaves. I seem to be a
shadow among the shadows of the trees. The more I warm
myself in this sun and take nourishment from this earth, the
more I seem to dissolve into rustlings and drops of water, in
the sound of the lake, and the growls of the forest. Behind
the trunks of the trees, in the stones, in my own sweat, there
is a remoteness, a distance.
  }
  ◊diana{These are the anxieties of your childhood.}
  ◊virbius{
I'm not a child any more. I know you, and I have been
in Hades. My own country is as far away as those clouds up
there. Look, I slip between trees and objects as though I
were a cloud.

You're happy, Hippolytus. If happiness is possible for
man, you are happy.
  }
  ◊virbius{
The boy I was, the boy who died, is happy. You saved
him, and I thank you. But the man who was reborn, your
servant, the fugitive from Hades who guards your oaks and
your forests—he isn't happy because he doesn't even know
if he exists. Who answers his voice, who speaks to him?
Does his today add anything to his yesterday?
  }
  ◊diana{Is that all, Virbius? You want company?}
  ◊virbius{You know what I want.}

Mortals always end by wanting that. Why? Is it something
in your blood?

  ◊virbius{Are you asking me what blood is?}

Sacrificial blood has the savor of god in it. How many
times have I seen you pull back the head of a kid or the
◊; page-number 105
wolf, slash its throat, and plunge your hands into its blood!
I liked you for that. But that other blood, your own blood,
which swells your veins and blazes in your eyes—I'm less
familiar with that blood. I know that for you it is life and
destiny.
  }
  ◊virbius{
I have already shed that blood. And feeling it run restless
and confused in me today is my proof of being alive.
The light of the lake, the green thrust of the trees—these
are not enough for me. They are things like clouds, everlasting
wanderers of morning and evening, guardians of the
horizons, shapes of Hades. Only other blood can still my
own. Blood running restlessly, and then stilled. Sated.
  }
  ◊diana{In short, you want to sacrifice?}
  ◊virbius{
That is what I want, Wild One. Before, when I was
Hippolytus, I sacrificed wild animals. They were enough. But
here in this land of the dead, even the animals dissolve between
my hands like clouds. It is my fault, I think. But I
need the closeness of warm blood, blood of my own kind.
I need to have a voice and a fate. O Wild One, grant me
this.
  }
  ◊diana{Beware, Virbius-Hippolytus. You have been happy.}

I don't care, lady. I've looked at my reflection in the lake
too often. It's life I want, not happiness.

When Odysseus came to Circe's island, he had been
warned of the danger and immunized, magically,
against her spells. But the witch Circe—an ancient
Mediterranean goddess who had come down in the
world—had known for some time that an Odysseus
would enter her life. In this respect Homer's
account leaves something to be desired.
  }

  ◊interlocutors{Circe, Leucothea}

  ◊circe{
Believe me, Leucò, I didn't understand all at once. Sometimes
you get the formula wrong, your mind suddenly goes
blank. And yet I'd touched him. The truth is I'd been expecting
him so long that I wasn't thinking about it anymore.
The moment I understood—he made a sudden movement
and reached for his sword—I almost smiled, I felt so
happy and at the same time disappointed. I even thought I
could avoid the whole affair and escape what had been fated.
After all, I said to myself, Odysseus is a man who wants to
go home. I thought about putting him in a boat immediately.
There he was, Leucò my dear, waving that sword of
his, ridiculous and clever as only a mortal can be—and I had
to smile and look at him square in the eye the way I do with
them, then look surprised and draw back. I felt as though I
were a girl again—when we were girls and they told us what
we'd do when we were grown up, and we all giggled. The
whole thing was like a dance. He took me by the wrists,
raised his voice, I blushed—I paled inwardly, Leucò—I
clasped his knees and went into my act. "Who are you, what
land gave birth to you . . ." Poor fellow, I thought to myself,
he doesn't know what's in store for him. He was a big man,
curly haired, handsome, Leucò. What a wonderful boar he
would have made—or maybe a wolf.
  }
  ◊leuco{
But did you tell him all this, during the year he spent
with you?
  }
  ◊circe{
Oh child, you don't speak of the things of destiny with a
◊; page-number 109
mortal. They think they've said the last word when they call
it the Iron Chain, the Fatal Decree and so on. They call us
the Fatal Ladies, you know.
  }
  ◊leuco{They don't know how to smile.}
  ◊circe{
Yes. Some of them can laugh in the face of destiny, but
they laugh afterwards. At the time they have to be serious
about it or they die. They don't know how to joke about
divine things, they don't have the sense of playing a role, as
we do. Their life is so short they can't bear to do things already
done or already known. If I talked to Odysseus in this
vein, he looked mystified and started talking about Penelope.
And he was a brave man.
  }
  ◊leuco{How tiresome.}
  ◊circe{
Yes, but you see I really understood him. With Penelope
he didn't have to smile; with her everything, even their daily
meal, was serious and unrehearsed—they might have been
preparing themselves for death. You can't imagine the way
death fascinates them. They're destined to die, of course, it's
a repetition, something they know in advance. And yet they
deceive themselves into thinking that it changes something.
  }
  ◊leuco{Then why didn't he want to become a boar?}
  ◊circe{
Oh Leucò, he didn't even want to become a god, though
Calypso, that silly creature, kept nagging him about it. But
that was the way Odysseus was, neither boar nor god, just
man, a very intelligent man and clever in the face of destiny.
  }
  ◊leuco{Tell me, my dear, did you enjoy yourself with him?}
  ◊circe{
Something occurs to me, Leucò. Not one of us goddesses
has ever tried to become mortal, no one has ever wanted it.
Yet this might be the new thing, the thing that might break
the chain.
  }
  ◊leuco{Would you like to?}
  ◊circe{
Really, Leucò. Odysseus didn't understand why I smiled.
Often he didn't even understand that I was smiling. I
thought once I had explained to him why animals are more
◊; page-number 110
like us immortals than a brave, intelligent man can be. An
animal eats, it mounts, it has no memory. He answered that
at home there was a dog waiting for him, a poor dog that
may have been dead already. And he told me its name. That
dog had a ◊em{name,} Leucò.
  }
  ◊leuco{They give us names too, you know.}
  ◊circe{
Odysseus gave me many names when he was in bed with
me. There was a new one every time. At first it was like the
noise an animal makes, a boar or a wolf, but bit by bit he
himself realized that he was spelling out the syllables of a
single word. He called me by the names of all the goddesses,
of our sisters, he called me by the names of the Mother of
all living things. It was as though he were struggling with
me, with fate. He wanted to name me, to hold me, make me
mortal. He wanted to break something. He brought intelligence
and courage to the job—he had both—but he could
never smile. He never understood the smile of the gods, the
way we, who know destiny, smile.
  }
  ◊leuco{
No man understands us, or the animals either. I've
seen these men of yours—transformed into wolves or wild
boars they still howl like real men. It's tormenting. They're
so crude in spite of their intelligence. Have you played with
them much?
  }
  ◊circe{
I amuse myself with them, Leucò, as best I can. I wasn't
granted a god in my bed, and the only man was Odysseus.
All the others turn into animals at my touch; they go crazy
and come after me, like wild beasts. Their frenzy is no better
and no worse than the love of a god. But with them I
mustn't even smile. I feel them mount me and then run off
back to their lairs. I don't lower my eyes.
  }
  ◊leuco{And Odysseus . . .}
  ◊circe{
I don't ask myself their names. Do you know who Odysseus
was?
  }
  ◊leuco{Yes, Circe?}
◊; page-number 111
  ◊circe{
One evening he described his arrival at Aeaea. His men
were frightened, they posted guards by the ships, and he told
me how all night long, stretched out their on the shore
under their cloaks, they listened to the roaring and the
snarling. Then when the sun rose, they saw a spiral of smoke
beyond the woods and they shouted for joy as they recognized
their country and their homes. He smiled as he told
me about this—in the way men smile—sitting beside me in
front of the fire. He said he wanted me to forget who I was and
where he was. That evening he called me Penelope.
  }
  ◊leuco{Oh Circe, how silly!}
  ◊circe{I was silly too, Leucò, and I told him to cry.}
  ◊leuco{Why, the idea.}
  ◊circe{
No, but he didn't cry. He knew that Circe loves wild animals,
who don't cry. He cried later on, the day I told him of
the long journey still to make and the descent into Avernus
and the blackness of Ocean. But they were the kind of tears
that clean your eyes and give you strength—I too can understand
them. But that evening, laughing strangely, he spoke
to me about his childhood and his destiny, and he asked
about me. He spoke playfully, of course.
  }
  ◊leuco{I don't understand.}
  ◊circe{
His mouth and his voice laughed, but his eyes were full of
memories. And then he told me to sing. And as I sang, I
went to the loom, and I put his home and his childhood
into that harsh voice of mine, I gentled it, I was his Penelope.
He took his head between his hands.
  }
  ◊leuco{Who had the last laugh?}
  ◊circe{
No one, Leucò. That evening, I was mortal too. I had a
name: Penelope. That was the only time I looked my fate
in the face without laughing, the only time I lowered my
eyes.
  }
  ◊leuco{And this man loved a dog?}
  ◊circe{
A dog, a woman, his son, and a boat to sail the sea. He
never looked on the endless cycle of days as destiny, he ran
◊; page-number 112
towards his death knowing what it was, and enriched the
earth with words and actions.
  }
  ◊leuco{
I don't have eyes like you, Circe, but here I feel it's
my turn to smile. You were naive. If you'd told him that the
wolves and boars mounted you like an animal, he'd have
turned into an animal himself.
  }
  ◊circe{
I did tell him. His mouth contracted, only a little though,
and after a while he said—"So long as they're not my men."
  }
  ◊leuco{So he was jealous.}
  ◊circe{
No, not jealous. He was loyal to them. He understood
everything, that man, except the way we gods smile. The day
when he wept in my bed, it wasn't because he was afraid,
but because his last journey was imposed on him by fate, it
was something he knew in advance. "Why trouble to make
the journey, in that case?" he asked me as he buckled on his
sword and walked down to the sea. I brought him the black
lamb and while his men were weeping, he noticed a flight of
swallows over the roof. "So they're going too," he said.
"They don't know what they're doing. But you know, lady."
  }
  ◊leuco{Is that all he said?}
  ◊circe{That was all.}
  ◊leuco{Circe, why didn't you kill him?}
  ◊circe{
I'm a real fool. Sometimes I forget that we immortals
◊em{know.} Then I'm as happy as though I were still a girl. As
though all these things happened to the great gods, to the
Olympians, and happened in this way, inexorably, but absurdly,
unforeseen. What I never manage to foresee is precisely
this, that I ◊em{have} foreseen, that I always know what I'm
going to do and say. And in this way what I do and say becomes
something always new and surprising. Like a game—like
that game of chess which Odysseus taught me, all rules
and regulations, but so new and exciting, with those lovely
ivory pieces! That game is like life, he used to say. According
to him, it was a way of overcoming time.
  }
  ◊leuco{
You have too many memories of him, Circe. You
◊; page-number 113
didn't turn him into a boar or a wolf. You turned him into
memory.
  }
  ◊circe{
That's the one immortal thing about a mortal, Leucò. The
memory he carries with him, the memory he leaves behind
him. That is what names and words are. When they remember
even men smile. A smile of resignation.

It's not that. I'm thinking of the Cretans and how little

its endless courtyards one after the other, and the soldiers
calling me the Bull-King—do you remember, Lelegus? You
become what you kill in Crete. Later I began to think I
understood them. Then they told us about the forests of Ida
where the caves of the gods are, where the gods were born
and where they died. Did you know, Lelegus? In the island
the gods are killed, killed like animals. And the man who
kills a god becomes a god himself. It was then that we tried
to climb Mt. Ida.

cloth. What do you expect them to do?

Not sit around ripening in the sun, thinking about gods
all the time. Not look for gods in the trunks of trees and in
the sea. Not chase after bulls. At first I thought it was their
fathers' fault—those decadent merchants who dress like
women and spend their time watching boys vaulting over
bulls. And that isn't all. It's as though they were another
race, another breed. There was a time when there were only
goddesses on Ida. Only a single goddess. She was the sun,
◊; page-number 118
she was the trees, she was the sea. And in her presence gods
and men were trampled underfoot. When a woman runs
away from a man to be with the sun and the beasts, it is not

Too docile, Lelegus. Like grass, like sea water. You
looked at her and realized she wasn't even aware of you.
Like the meadows of Ida—you move forward, your hand on
your axe, and then suddenly the silence becomes suffocating
and you have to stop. There's a sound of breathing, like a
beast about to spring. Even the sun seems to be lying in
wait, even the air . . . There's no fighting with the great
Goddess. You can't fight the earth and its silences.

Yes, I have known these things too. But Ariadne—she
let you out of the maze. She left home for you. She abandoned
her gods to follow you. If her blood was rotten, as you
say, she wouldn't have done that.

And the killer is the new god. Oh Lelegus, you can kill
gods and bulls in a cave, but the god you carry in your blood
cannot be killed. Ariadne too was blood and breed of the
island. I knew her as I knew the bull.

You were too cruel, Theseus. What do you suppose she said,
poor girl, when she woke on Naxos?

I know, I know. She must have howled, like a wild
thing. But in vain. She'll have called on her country and her
home and her gods. She still has the earth and the sun. We
Greeks are nothing to her now.

Whereas we are only men. I'm certain that a god will

sorrows, one of those who have already savored death, and

I wonder? A tree, a horse, a ram? Or perhaps a lake or a
cloud? Anything can happen on that sea of hers.

you. Sometimes you speak like a boy playing a game.

Nothing crazy about it! If the Tantalids lost their heads—literally,

kings who live cooped up in those mountain castles of
theirs . . . There may have been a time when they saw the
world—Tantalus certainly did. But after him they shut
themselves up with their women and their piles of gold—suspicious
and discontented, incapable of energy or action.
The sea fed them, fed them well: fat, gross, gluttonous men.

For them or others, Poly, the names don't matter. It's the
house of Atreus we're talking about. And if the women of
that house, from Hippodameia on, were as like one another

say the story of that family is the same man looking
for the same woman: and finding her, over and over. Every
one of their women, from Hippodameia down to Helen and
Clytemnestra, has had to fight and defend herself. This is
obviously what the Tantalids like in their women. They

men of blood. Fat men, bloated with power. They need a

Who cares what Hippodameia did? All right, so she
whipped her horses in that chariot race. I know the story too.

compare them?

We don't know much about women, do we, Poly? We
all grew up together, and to us she's still a little girl playing

Menelaus.

  ◊pollux{Anyway, what was so bad about Hippodameia?}
  ◊castor{
She treated men as though they were horses. That's what.
She got her charioteer to murder her father. Then she had
Pelops murder the charioteer. She gave birth to Atreus and
Thyestes, both murderers. She made blood flow in torrents.
◊em{She} didn't run away, not her.
  }
  ◊pollux{But didn't you say that all this was Pelops' fault?}
  ◊castor{
I said that Pelops and all the men of his family preferred
women like that. That they deserved the women they got.
  }
  ◊pollux{
But Helen doesn't murder. She doesn't make men
murder.
  }
  ◊castor{
Are you sure, Poly? Remember when we got her back
from Theseus—three horses galloping through the forest? If
we weren't all killed then, it was because we were boys and
to us it was almost a game. And wasn't it you who asked just
now how much blood the Atreidae will shed?
  }
  ◊pollux{But she doesn't drive anyone to murder.}
  ◊castor{
Do you think Hippodameia drove the charioteer? She
simply smiled and said her father wanted her. She didn't
even say she disliked the idea . . . A look can kill. Then
when Myrtilus saw he'd been tricked by Pelops and he
wanted to shout out the truth, all Hippodameia had to say
to her husband was: "Keep your eyes on that man—he
knows about Oenomaus." The Tantalids have a liking for
that kind of talk.
  }
  ◊pollux{Do all their women kill, then?}
  ◊castor{
No, not all. Some bow their heads and resign themselves.
But sooner or later the castle unleashes the beast in them.
The Tantalids kill and are killed. They have to whip or be
whipped.
  }
  ◊pollux{Helen just ran away.}
  ◊castor{You think so, Poly? Remember Atreus' wife, Aerope?}
  ◊pollux{She was drowned.}
  ◊castor{
But not before she drove her lover to steal the golden
◊; page-number 126
ram. There's a woman who was driven wild by the castle.
A woman who could have spent her days in idle lechery,
growing fat beside her lover. But her lover was Thyestes, her
husband was Atreus. They had chosen her and they left her
no way out. They unleashed the beast in her too, like the
other women. The Tantalids have a craving for violence.
  }
  ◊pollux{
Our sister too? You mean they'll put her to death for
adultery? You mean she's a whore?
  }
  ◊castor{
If only she were, Poly, if only she were. But being a whore
isn't a matter of choice. Not when you're married to one of
the Atreidae. Don't you see that for them sexual pleasure
means taking a woman by force, beating her till she bleeds?
They wouldn't know what to do with a tame, submissive
woman. They need a woman with cold, killer's eyes, eyes
without shame. Eyes like arrow-slits. Like Hippodameia's.
  }
  ◊pollux{I've seen that look in Helen's eyes.}

They need the cruelty of a virgin. The virgin who moves
on the mountains. ◊em{She,} she is the woman they marry. For
her they serve up their sons, for her they murder their daughters . . .

the water like a dove.

As a matter of fact, it didn't It was on a morning like that
we put out from Iolchos. We were all young and the gods
were with us. It was wonderful just sailing on, without a
thought of tomorrow. Then strange, incredible things began
to happen . . . It was a younger world, Melita, with days
like clear mornings, nights of dense blackness, a world
where anything could happen. Sometimes the strange
◊; page-number 130
things were men, sometimes they were monsters, or springs,
or rocks. Some of us disappeared, some died. Every landfall
was a loss. Every day the sea was more beautiful, more virginal.
The days went by in waiting for something . . . Then
the rains came, fogs, black foam.
  }
  ◊melita{Yes, you have told me of these things.}
  ◊jason{
The danger wasn't the sea. We realized, from one landfall
to the next, that we had grown during our journey. We
were stronger, more detached. We were like gods, Melita,
but it was this that led us toward fatal risks. So we made
land at Phasis, there on the fields of golden crocus. Oh I was
young then, and I looked squarely at my fate.

When we talk of you and your companions, in the temple,
we lower our voices.

old fellow stop running on about his gods, they say. Anyway,
those gods are dead, aren't they, like the rest of the gods?—Life
is what Corinth wants.

Up at the temple, we talk about the witch, king Jason.
Some people still remember her. Tell me about her, sir.

We violated the sea, we destroyed monsters, we walked
through the fields of saffron. A golden cloud glittered in the
wood. And yet everyone of us died through the arts of a
witch, everyone of us died by the spells of the passion of
a witch. One of our crew had his head torn off and thrown
into a river. One has grown old. He's talking to you now . . .

I never saw her cry, Medea couldn't cry. And the only time
she ever smiled was when she said she would go away with
me.

But she did go away with you, king Jason, she left her
country and her home, she accepted her fate. You were cruel
like all young men. Even you.

I was young, Melita. Nobody laughed at me in those days.
But I didn't know then that your way, the way of the temple,
is wiser, and that what I asked of the goddess was impossible.
But for us everything seemed possible. We had
destroyed the dragon, captured the golden cloud. Men do
evil trying to be great, trying to be gods.
  }
  ◊melita{But why is your victim always a woman?}
  ◊jason{
Little Melita, you're one of the temple girls. Surely you all
know that when a man climbs up there it's because he
wants to become a god, at least for a day, for an hour. Because
he wants to sleep with you as though you were the
goddess. He always pretends he's sleeping with her, then he
realizes it's only mortal flesh he was dealing with, poor
human creatures like you and your friends up there, like all
women. Then he flies into a rage and tries to be a god somewhere
else.

Oh yes, men grown old before their time, men who pay
your visits . . . But not before they've tried everything else.

son of Aegeus who went down to Hades to bring back
Persophone—the son of that king of Athens who threw himself
into the sea?

overseas, a woman who helped him in a fatal task, as the
witch helped me. He abandoned her, on an island, early one
morning. Then there were new conquests, new horizons, and
lunar Antiope, that restless Amazon, was his. And then
Phaedra, the light of the day, and she too killed herself. And
Helen, the daughter of Leda. Till at last he tried to snatch
Persephone from the jaws of Hades. There was only one
woman he never wanted—the one who fled from Corinth,
who murdered her children, the witch . . . You know about
her.

Theseus. And since then you haven't made any woman cry.

Thinks aren't what they used to be, somehow. "He'll

Ouranos and Chaos. The world seems to be divided. Every
event had its goal, and everything that lived was one. But
now there's a law and a mind. Zeus has made himself immortal

revolt. They were defeated and he simply smiled, smiled.
That was how he crushed the Titans, and mankind. I admired
him then; he was merciless. And I remember another

the fennel stalk. And with their women and their offerings
and their songs and their fine words they have persuaded
some of us immortals to go down among them and be kind
to them and have children by them. Do you see what they're

But that didn't mean his power was lost. No, it was
the lords of Chaos who were lost, they who once ruled over

a name and without a law. The change came later. It took
a great deal to turn the son of Kronos into the good Judge,
into restless, immortal mind. He had first to take flight and
suffer the unjust punishment of living in exile among men
when he was still a baby, suckled by a goat. He had to grow
up on the mountain and the forests. Men had first to find
words and the laws to live by, grief and death and the
sense of loss. Only then did the son of Kronos change his
nature. And you, do you think you really helped him to
crush the Titans? Why, he fought as though he had won
already. You said so yourself. The reborn child became the
master living among men.

These mortals are really amusing. We know things,
and they do them. I wonder what our lives would be like
without them. What would we Olympians be? They call on
us with their feeble voices, and they give us names.
  }
  ◊demeter{
I existed before there were men, and I can tell you it
was lonely. The earth was forest, snakes, turtles. We were
the earth, the air, the water. What could one do? It was
in those days that we began the custom of being immortal.
  }
  ◊dionysus{With men that never happens.}
  ◊demeter{
True. Everything they touch becomes time. Becomes
action. Waiting and hope. Even their dying is something.
  }
  ◊dionysus{
They have a way of giving names to themselves and
things and us which enriches life. Like the vineyards that
they've taught themselves to grow on these hillsides. When
I brought the first vine to Eleusis, I never dreamed they
would make such a delicious place of these wild, rocky
slopes. And the same is true of their crops and their gardens.
Wherever they lavish their sweat and their speech, a
rhythm, a sense, a repose is born.
  }

And that talent they have for making stories about us!
I sometimes wonder if I really am Gaia, Rhea, Cybele, the
Great Mother, as they say I am. They have the knack of
giving us names that reveal us to ourselves, Iacchus. They
lift us from the grey eternity of fate and quicken us with
colors, painting us in the days and places where we are.

Who could have guessed that their wretched lives

owe it to them.

Then shouldn't we help them more, Dionysus? Make
amends to them somehow? Stand at their side in the brief

You gave them grain, Deo. I gave them the vine. Let
them be. What more do they need?
  }
  ◊demeter{
I don't know why it is, but our gifts are always ambiguous.
Double-bladed axes. My son Triptolemus almost had
his throat cut when he brought that Scythian stranger his
gift of grain. Even your gifts cause the shedding of innocent
blood, Dionysus. Or so I hear.
  }
  ◊dionysus{
But they wouldn't be men if they weren't miserable.
Death is what they're born for. It's death that drives them
to their efforts, to memory and foresight. And don't go
supposing, Deo, that their blood is any better than the wheat
or wine with which we feed it. Blood is vile, foul, wretched.
  }
  ◊demeter{
You're young Iacchus, and you don't know that they
discovered us in blood. You course restlessly through the
world, and for you death is like wine: exalting, an ecstasy.
But you forget that mortals have suffered every story they
tell of us. How many mortal mothers have lost their Core
and never seen her again? Even today the richest offering
they can make is blood.
  }
  ◊dionysus{
Is it an offering, Deo? You know better than I that
there was a time when they thought that in killing their
victim they were killing us.
  }
  ◊demeter{
Can you blame them? This is why I said they discovered
us in blood. If for them death is the end and the
◊; page-number 148
beginning, then they have to kill us in order to see us
reborn. They are very unhappy, Iacchus.
  }
  ◊dionysus{
You think so? They seem stupid to me. But maybe
not. They are so mortal that by killing themselves they give
a meaning to life. They have to live and die their own
stories. Take what happened to Icarius . . .
  }
  ◊demeter{Poor Erigone.}
  ◊dionysus{
Yes, but Icarius was killed because he wanted to be
killed. Maybe he thought his blood was wine. He gathered
the grapes, pressed them, and drew off the wine. He worked
like a madman. It was the first time a froth of must was
ever seen on a threshing-floor. The bushes, the walls, the
shovels were spattered with it. Even Erigone plunged her
hands in it. Then what did the stupid old fool do but go
down to the fields and ask the herdsmen to drink with him?
And when they were drunk on it, poisoned, raging like wild
animals, they tore him to pieces like a goat among the scrub
and then buried him in order to grow more wine. He knew
what would happen, it was what he wanted. Was Erigone
surprised? No, she'd tasted that wine, she knew it would
happen too. So how else could she round off this story
except by hanging herself in the sun like a bunch of grapes?
There's nothing sad about it. Mortals tell their stories with
blood.
  }

And do you think this sort of thing is worthy of us?
You were wondering what we would be like without them.
You know that someday they may grow tired of us gods. You
understand? Your own interests as a god are bound up with
blood—that wretched blood, as you call it.

turn it into blood. Always blood.

  ◊demeter{By teaching them the life of the blessèd.}
  ◊dionysus{But that's tempting fate, Deo. They're mortals.}
  ◊demeter{
Listen. The day will come when they'll think of it
themselves. And they'll do it without us, with a story.
They'll tell stories of men who have conquered death.
They've already put one of their number in heaven. Every
six months one of them goes down to Hades. One of them
has fought with Death and won back a living creature . . .
Mark my words, Iacchus. They'll do it on their own. And
then we'll go back to being what we were: air, water, and
earth.
  }
  ◊dionysus{It won't help them live longer.}

Of course not, silly boy. But their dying will have a
meaning. They too will die in order to be reborn, and they
won't need us anymore.
  }
  ◊dionysus{What do you suggest, Deo?}
  ◊demeter{
Teach them that they can become like us, beyond grief
and death. But we'll tell them ourselves. Teach them that
just as the wheat and the vine go down beneath the earth
in order to be born again, so death is a new life for them
too. Give them this holy story. Lead them upward by means
of this story. Teach them a fate which is woven with our
own.

  ◊dionysus{They'll die anyway.}
  ◊demeter{
They'll die, and they will conquer death. They will
see something beyond blood, they will see the two of us.
They'll no longer be afraid of death, and they won't have to
placate it by shedding other blood.
  }
  ◊dionysus{
We can do it, Deo, we can. We can give them the
story of eternal life. I almost envy them. They won't know
destiny and they will be immortal. But don't expect the
bloodshed to stop.

Their only thought will be eternity. But there's one
danger. They may neglect these fertile fields.

For a while. But once the grain and the vineyard take
on the meaning of eternal life, do you know what men will
see in bread and wine? Flesh and blood, as now, as always.
Flesh and blood will be spilled, not to placate death but to
reach the eternal which awaits them.

tomorrow morning, in that terrible dawn, when they see

Many things, sweet goat. For them we are like wild animals.
Animals are born and die like the leaves. They glimpse
us disappearing between the branches and they begin to
think of us as being somehow divine—that when we run to
hide we are the life that endures in the forest—a life like
their own, but everlasting, a richer life. They'll come looking
for us. Mark my words. We'll be their last hope.

  ◊hamadryad{Hope? In a rain like this? And what will they do?}

Don't you know what it means to hope? They'll believe
that a forest where we live can't possibly be flooded. They'll
tell themselves that it's inconceivable that mankind should
utterly, totally, disappear; otherwise what meaning would
there be in being born and knowing us? They'll realize that
the great gods, the gods of Olympus, desire their death. But
we, like them, like the little animals, are life, earth, the
reality that matters. The seasons of their life are festivals,
and we are their festivals, the life they celebrate.

serves them right.

Listen to the girl. But dying is precisely this—no longer
knowing that you're dead. And this is what this flood means:
dying in such numbers that there won't be anyone left to
know it. That's why they'll come to look for us. And they'll
ask us to save them and they'll want to become like us, like
plants and stones—insensible things that are nothing but
destiny. In them they will save themselves. When the waters
retreat, they'll come forth as stones and trees, just as
they did before. And this is all that mortals want, just as
before.
  }
  ◊hamadryad{
Strange people. They treat destiny and the future as
though it were a past.

That's the meaning of hope. Giving destiny a name to
remember it by.

and trees?
  }
  ◊satyr{
They have the knack of making myths, these mortals. Their
future lives will be modeled upon the imaginative shape they
give to their terror of tonight and tomorrow. They will be
wild animals and rocks and plants. They will be gods. They
will even dare to kill the gods in order to make them live
again. They will give themselves a past in order to escape
death. They are only and always these two things: hope or
destiny.
  }

If that's so, I can't pity them. It must be wonderful
to live in a world of utter make-believe.
  }
  ◊satyr{
Yes, it's wonderful. But you mustn't suppose that they're
aware of improvising, of their make-believe. Their most
◊; page-number 155
miraculous escapes have been made quite by accident, when
they were already caught in the crushing grip of destiny.
They don't have time to savor their own make-believe. All
they can do is pay for it in person. That much they can do.
  }
  ◊hamadryad{
Well, I hope this flood at least serves to teach them
the meaning of festival and play. After all, there's a make-believe
which destiny imposes upon us immortals and which
we are aware of—why can't they learn to live their make-believe
as though each moment of their wretched little lives
was eternal? Why won't they realize that it's precisely the
shortness of their lives that gives them their value?
  }
  ◊satyr{
One can't have everything, little one. We who know—we
have no preferences. And they, who live unpredictable,
unique moments, are ignorant of their value. They envy us
our eternity. Such is the world.
  }
  ◊hamadryad{
They too will learn something tomorrow. And the
clods of earth and the stones in which they will someday
make their return to the light, will not live solely in hope or
anguish. You'll see. In the new world even the shortest lives
will be in some way blessed.

gnarled trunk with a look, as though you had recognized an
old friend, and it spoke to you precisely the one word your
heart was hoping for. At times it's the glance of a man passing
in the street. Sometimes the rain that drives down for
days on end. Or the hoarse cry of a bird. Or a cloud you
think you've seen somewhere before. For an instant time
stops, and you experience the trivial event as though before

me. But these mortal instants are not a life. If I
wanted to repeat them, they would lose their freshness. The
staleness always comes back.

else is memory but an experience repeated in its intensity?

olive tree, the glance, the cloud. You speak of a name, and the
thing exists forever.

found others in the mountains to the north, by the barren
torrents of Thrace and Pieria. I like you more than the
others. You know that immortal things are close at hand.

It's not hard to know that. What's hard is touching
them.

You have to live for them, Hesiod. That means
purity of the heart.

When I listen to you, yes. But a man's life is down there
in the valley, in the fields, at home. Beside a hearth and in
a bed. And every day that dawns confronts you with the
same toils, the same failures. In the end it wears a man
down, Melete. A sudden storm can refresh the fields—it
isn't death and the great sorrows that make a man lose heart.
But the everlasting, grinding toil, the effort to stay alive
from day to day, the recognition of evil in others, petty evil,

man, Melete.

fate. Have you ever heard of the swamp of Boibeïs?

A dank swamp of slime and reeds, exactly as it was
at the beginning of time, a seething, bubbling silence. It
spawned monsters of excrement and blood. Even today the
Thessalians seldom speak of it. Neither time nor the seasons
change it. No voice reaches there.

hallowed its fate. Your voice has reached it. Now it is a
terrible and a sacred place. The olives and the sky of Helicon

Neither is the staleness or the toil, nor returning to
the daily round. Don't you understand that man, every

the divine are with you too? In bed, in the fields, before the
fire? In everything you do, you renew a divine model. Day

Who can say? But surely they did see them. They told their
names, and that was all. There lies the whole difference between
stories and the truth. "It was this man, or that man."
"He did this, he said that." The man who tells the truth is
satisfied with that. He doesn't even suspect that his listeners
might not believe him. We are the liars. We have never seen
these things, and yet we know exactly what robe the centaur
wore or the color of the grapes on the threshing-floor of
Icarius.

All it takes is a hill, a peak, a shore. Any lonely place where
your eyes lift up and stop at the sky. The incredible relief of
things outlined in the air still seizes the heart. For my part I
believe that a tree, a rock, profiled against the sky, were gods
from the very beginning.

There was a time when even those things didn't exist up
here.

Agreed. Before them there were the voices of the earth—the
roots, the springs, he snakes. If the daemon links earth with
heaven, he must emerge into the light from the darkness of
the ground.

I don't know. Those people knew too many things. With a
simple name they told the story of the cloud, the forest, the
fates. They saw with certainty what we barely know. They
had neither the time nor the taste for losing themselves in
dreams. They saw terrible, incredible things, and weren't even
surprised. They knew what it was. If what they said was false,
who could blame them? In those days even you couldn't have
said "It's morning" or "it looks like rain" without losing
your head.
  }
  ◊x{
Yes, they spoke names. So much so that at times I wonder
whether the things or those names came first.
  }
  ◊x{
Believe me, they came together. And it happened here, in
these wild and lonely places. Is there anything surprising in
their coming here? What else could those people have looked
for in a place like this, if not an encounter with the gods?
  }
  ◊x{
Who can say why they stopped here? But in every abandoned
place, an emptiness, an expectation remains.
  }
  ◊x{
It's the only thing a man could think of, here. These places
have names forever. All that remains is the grass and the sky,
and yet the breath of the wind is more fragrant to the memory
than a storm in a forest. There is neither emptiness nor
expectation. What has been exists forever.
  }
  ◊x{
But those people are dead and buried. These places now are
what they were before there were men. I am willing to grant
you that what they said was true. But what else remains?
You'll admit that we no longer have encounters with gods on
the mountain paths. When I saw, "It's morning" or "It looks
like rain," I'm not talking about gods.

We talked about the gods tonight. Yesterday you were talking
about summer, and the desire you feel when you breathe the
warm evening air. At other times you talk about man, about
people you have known, of your past tastes, of unexpected
encounters. All things that once existed. I can assure you that
I listened to you as I listen once again to those ancient names

ask you, "But what else remains?" or whether the word or
the things came first. I live with you, and I feel myself alive.

It isn't easy to live as though what happened in another age
were real. Yesterday when the fog overtook us in lonely country,
and a couple of stones tumbled down from the hill to our
feet, we didn't think of divine things or a fantastic encounter,
but only of the night and the hares we had startled. Who we
are and what we believe emerge when we are confronted with
hardship, in the hour of risk.
  }
  ◊x{
When we are home again it will be pleasant to talk with our
friends about last night and the hares we startled. But our
fear is something to smile at if we think of the terror of those
people to whom everything that happened was mortal, fatal.
People for whom the air was crowded with nocturnal terrors,
mysterious threats, dreadful memories. Think, for instance, of
storms or earthquakes. And if their uneasiness was real—as it
certainly was—then the hope, the courage, the joyous discovery
of powers, of promises, of encounters, were also real. For
my part, I never tire of hearing them tell of the terrors in the
night and the things in which they set their hopes.

And you believe in the monsters? In the tales of men turned
into beasts, in the breathing rocks, in the divine smiles, and
the words that annihilated?

I believe in what every man has hoped for and suffered. If
they in their time climbed up to these rock-strewn heights, or
scoured the world for fatal swamps, it was because they found
in those places something of which we are ignorant. Not
bread, not pleasure. Not precious health. Men know where
those things are found. Not here. As for us who live far
away, down by the shore or in the fields, we have lost that
other thing.

  ◊x{That other thing? What do you mean?}
  ◊x{You know. Those encounters of theirs.}
