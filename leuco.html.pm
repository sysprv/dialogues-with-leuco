  ◊p[#:class "intro"]{
Had it been possible, I would gladly have done without all
this mythology. But myth, it seems to me, is a language of
its own, an instrument of expression. There is nothing arbitrary
about it. It is a seedbed of symbolic forms, possessing, like
all languages, its own rage of meanings which can be
conveyed in no other way. When we retell an old myth—a
proper name, an action, a heroic feat—we are expressing, with
the utmost economy of means, a general and comprehensive
fact, a core of reality which quickens and feeds a whole
organic growth of passion and human existence, an entire
conceptual complex. If this mythical name or action also
happens to be familiar to us from childhood, from our
schooldays, so much the better. What is more acutely
disturbing than to see familiar stories troubled into new life?
In these dialogues I have confined myself to Greek
mythology. For obvious reasons these myths have never lost
their popularity; they can count on both an immediate and a
traditional acceptance. At all costs I wanted to avoid
whatever is shapeless, irregular, accidental; even in subject
matter, I wanted to confine myself within a given frame; I
have tried for a concrete, finite presence. A true revelation,
I am convinced, can only emerge from stubborn concentration
on a single problem. I have nothing in common with
experimentalists, adventurers, with those who travel in strange
regions. The surest, and the quickest, way for us to arouse the
sense of wonder is to stare, unafraid, at a single object.
Suddenly—miraculously—it will look like something we have
never seen before.

  ◊dialogue-intro-title{THE CLOUD}
  ◊dialogue-intro{
It seems likely that Ixion was condemned to Tartarus
because of his presumptions. But that he fathered the
Centaurs on the clouds is false, since the race of Centaurs
already existed at the time of his son's marriage.
The Lapiths and the Centaurs belong to the age
of the Titans, when very different creatures
were still permitted to mate and interbreed. The
result was that swarm of monsters which Olympus
later pursued with implacable hatred.

  ◊dialogue-title{The Cloud, Ixion}

  ◊cloud{Ixion, there is a law and we must obey it.}
  ◊ixion{
The law has no power here, Nephele. Here the law is the
glacier, the storm, the darkness. And when at last the
weather clears and you drift softly toward the peak, it's no
time then to be thinking about the law.
  }
  ◊cloud{
There is a law, Ixion, which didn't exist before. A
stronger hand now masses the clouds.
  }
  ◊ixion{
That hand doesn't reach here. Look, the weather's clear,
and you're laughing, aren't you? And when the sky turns
black and the wind howls, who cares about the hand that
scatters us like rain? That was what happened in the days
when there was no master. Nothing has changed up here on
the mountains. We're used to all this.
  }
  ◊cloud{
Much has changed on the mountains. Pelion knows
it. Ossa and Olympus know it. Wilder mountains know it
too.
  }
  ◊ixion{What has changed on the mountains, Nephele?}
  ◊cloud{
Not the sun, not the rain, Ixion. Man's fate has
changed. There are monsters. A limit has been imposed
upon you mortals. The rain, the wind, the peak, and the
clouds are no longer yours to possess. You can no longer
hold them in your arms, live with them. Other hands now
hold the world. There is a law, Ixion.
  }
  ◊ixion{What law?}
  ◊cloud{You already know. Your fate, the limit imposed
upon you—
  }
◊; page-number 3
  ◊ixion{
I hold my fate in my fist, Nephele. What has changed?
Can these new masters stop me from throwing boulders
for the joy of it? Or from going down to the plain and
breaking an enemy's back? Are they any more terrible than
fatigue and death?
  }
  ◊cloud{
That's not it, Ixion. You can still do all that, and
more besides. But you can no longer mate with us, the
nymphs of the wind, the goddesses of the earth. Destiny has
changed.
  }
  ◊ixion{No longer? What do you mean, Nephele?}
  ◊cloud{
I mean that if you try to do what you once did, you'll
do something terrible. Like a man who tries to embrace a
friend and strangle him, or is strangled himself.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I don't understand. You mean you're leaving the mountain?
You're afraid of me?
  }
  ◊cloud{
I'll be here on the mountain, here and everywhere.
But I'm out of your reach, Ixion. You're powerless against
the rain and the wind. You must bow your head. That's
your only salvation.
  }
  ◊ixion{You're afraid, Nephele.}
  ◊cloud{
Yes, I'm afraid. I've seen the mountain peaks. But
I'm not afraid for myself, Ixion. I cannot suffer. I'm afraid
for you—you who are only men. These mountains where
you were once the masters, where you used to run, and
these creatures, our children, conceived when we were both
free, now tremble at a nod. We are all the slaves of a
stronger hand. The Centaurs, sons of the wind and the
rain, are hiding in the deep ravines. They know they are
monsters.
  }
  ◊ixion{Who says so?}
  ◊cloud{
Don't defy that hand, Ixion. It is fate. I've seen
others, more reckless than you or the Centaurs, hurl themselves
from the cliff and not die. Understand me, Ixion.
◊; page-number 4
Death, in which your courage was defined, can be taken
from you, like a blessing refused. Do you know this?
  }
  ◊ixion{
You've told me so before. What does it matter? We'll
live more intensely.
  }
  ◊cloud{You can't be serious. You don't know the immortals.}
  ◊ixion{I want to know them, Nephele.}
  ◊cloud{
Ixion, you think they're presences like us, like Night,
Earth, or old Pan. You're young, Ixion, but you were born
under the old dispensation. For you there are no monsters,
there are only friends. For you death is something that
happens, like day, like night. You're one of us, Ixion. What
you are is what you do, and that is all. But for them, the
immortals, everything you do has a meaning that lingers.
And they probe everything from far off, with their eyes,
their nostrils, their lips. They are immortal and they cannot
live for themselves alone. What you achieve or don't
achieve, what you say, what you search for—all these things
gladden or displease them. And if you offend them—if you
make the mistake of disturbing them on their Olympus
—they swoop down upon you, bringing death—the death
which they know, a bitterness which lasts, which is felt
forever.
  }
  ◊ixion{We can still die.}
  ◊cloud{
No, Ixion. They will turn you into a kind of shadow,
a shade that wants to live but never dies.
  }
  ◊ixion{Have you seen them, these gods of yours?}
  ◊cloud{
I have seen them . . . Oh Ixion, you don't know
what you're asking.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I've seen some of them too, Nephele. I don't find them
so terrible.
  }
  ◊cloud{
I knew it. Your fate is sealed. Which one did you
see?
  }
  ◊ixion{
How could I tell? It was a young man. He was walking
barefoot through the forest. He passed by me, but didn't
◊; page-number 5
speak. Then he vanished before a cliff. For a long time
I stood there looking for him, too amazed to move. I wanted
to ask him who he was. He seemed to be a creature of flesh,
like you.
  }
  ◊cloud{Is he the only one you saw?}
  ◊ixion{
I saw him again in a dream, with the goddesses. I seemed
to be standing beside them, talking and laughing with them.
And they were telling me the same things that you're saying,
but without fear, without trembling like you. We talked
together of fate and death. We talked about Olympus. We
laughed at the ridiculous monsters—
  }
  ◊cloud{
O Ixion, Ixion, your fate is sealed! Now you know
what has changed up there above the mountains. And
you've changed too. And you think you're more than a man.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I tell you, Nephele, that you're like them. Why shouldn't
I admire them, at least in a dream?
  }
  ◊cloud{
Fool, you can't stop at dreams. You'll climb up to
them, aspire to them. You'll do something terrible. Then
that death of theirs will come.
  }
  ◊ixion{Tell me all the goddesses' names.}
  ◊cloud{
You see? Dreaming isn't enough for you now.
You believe in your dream as if it were real. I implore you,
Ixion, don't climb to the top. Think of the monsters and
how they were punished. The same thing will happen to
you.
  }
  ◊ixion{
I had another dream last night. You were in it too,
Nephele. We were fighting the Centaurs. I had a son whose
mother was one of the goddesses—I don't know which. And
he looked like that same young god who was walking
through the forest. He was stronger than me, Nephele. The
Centaurs ran away, and the mountain was ours. You were
laughing, Nephele. You see, even in my dreams, I can
accept my fate.
  }
◊; page-number 6
  ◊cloud{
Your fate is sealed. No one lifts his eyes to a goddess
with impunity.
  }
  ◊ixion{
Not even to the Goddess of the Oaks, the Lady of the
Peaks?
  }
  ◊cloud{
It doesn't matter which, Ixion. But don't be afraid.
I'll be with you till the end.

  ◊dialogue-intro-title{THE CHIMERA}
  ◊dialogue-intro{
It was with high hearts that the youth of Greece set out
for the East in quest of glory and death. Here their
courage and daring took them through a sea of fabulous
atrocities, in which some of them failed to keep their
heads. There is no point in citing names. Besides, there
were more than seven such Crusades. It is Homer
himself who—in Book VI of the ◊roman{Iliad}—tells us of the
melancholy which consumed the killer of the Chimera
in his old age, and of his young grandson Sarpedon
who died under the walls of Troy.
  }
◊; page-number 8

  ◊dialogue-title{Hippolochus, Sarpedon}

  ◊hippolochus{Ah, there you are, boy.}
  ◊sarpedon{
Hippolochus, I found your father. He won't hear of
coming home. You should see him. He's a terrible sight—
plodding through the countryside, covered with filth, oblivious
of the weather. He's an old beggar, Hippolochus.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What do the peasants say about him?}
  ◊sarpedon{
The Aleian plain is deserted, a wilderness, Uncle.
Reeds and swampland, nothing else. I asked about him in
the valley of the Xanthus, but they hadn't seen him for days.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What about him? What does he say?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He has no memory of home or us. Whenever he meets
somebody, he talks to him about the Solymi, of Glaucus,
Sisyphus, and the Chimera. When he saw me, he said, "if
I were your age, boy, I'd go drown myself." He doesn't
threaten the living. "Boy," he said to me, "you're just,
you're merciful. We're just and merciful men. If you want
to stay just and merciful, stop living."
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
Bellerophon bitter? Bellerophon grumbling? I can't
believe it.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
You should hear the terrible threats he makes. He
dares the gods to accept his challenge. Night and day he
keeps on walking. All his rancor, all his bitterness, is lavished
on the dead—or rather on the gods.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Glaucus and Sisyphus, you mean?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He says they were punished by treachery. Why wait
until they're old and feeble before ambushing them? "Bellerophon,"
◊; page-number 9
he says, "was just and merciful as long as the
blood coursed in his body. And now that he's old and
alone, why do the gods decide to abandon him?"
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
It's strange that should surprise him. And that he
should blame the gods for something which every living
thing must suffer. But he was always just. What do he and
those dead men have in common?
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
Listen, Hippolochus. When I saw those desperate
eyes of his, I too wondered if this was really Bellerophon
I was talking to. Something has happened to your father.
Not just old age. Not just misery and loneliness. Your
father is atoning for the death of the Chimera.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Are you mad, Sarpedon?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Your father accuses the gods of injustice because they
wanted him to kill the Chimera. Over and over again he
says, "From the day I stained myself with the monster's
blood, I haven't had a real life. I have looked for men to
fight, tamed the Amazons, slaughtered the Solymi. I ruled
over Lycia and I planted a great garden—but all this was
nothing. Where can I find another Chimera? Where is the
strength of the arms that killed her? Sisyphus and my
father Glaucus were just men, young men—then as they
grew old, the gods abandoned them both, let them become
wild animals and die. How can the man who met the
Chimera resign himself to death?" That's how your father
talks. The man who used to be Bellerophon.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
From Sisyphus, who chained the infant Thanatos,
to Glaucus who fed living men to his mares, our breed
has broken its bounds. But these are men of the past; they
belonged to an age of monsters. The Chimera was the last
monster they knew. Our land is just and merciful now.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
Are you sure, Hippolochus? You think that killing
the Chimera was enough? Our father—I can call him that
—should know. And yet he's as gloomy as a god—some
◊; page-number 10
white-haired old tramp of a god—and he roams through
fields and swamps talking to his dead.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What is he looking for?}
  ◊sarpedon{
The arm that killed the Chimera. He wants the pride
of Glaucus and Sisyphus, especially now that he, like them,
has reached the boundary of things, the limit, the end.
Their courage torments him. He knows a second Chimera
will never lie in wait for him among the rocks. And he
defies the gods.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
Sarpedon, I'm his son, but these are things I can't
understand. The earth is just a place now—why can't men
grow old in piece? In a young man, almost a boy like you,
Sarpedon, I can understand the tumult of the blood. But
only in a young man. Only for a just cause. Not revolt
against the gods.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
But he knows what it's like to be young, he knows
what old age is like. He's seen other days. He has looked
at the gods, as you and I look at each other now. He tells
of terrible things.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Why listen then?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Oh Hippolochus, who could help listening? Bellerophon
has seen things which don't often happen.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
I know, Sarpedon, I know. But that world is over.
When I was a child, he told me the same stories.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
But there's a difference—he wasn't talking with the
dead in those days. They were only stories then. But now
every destiny he meets becomes his own.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{What did he tell you?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Things you already know. But what you can't know
is the coldness, the desperation in his eye, like the look of
a man who is no longer anything but who knows everything.
Stories of Lydia and Phrygia, old stories, without
justice, without mercy. You know the story of Silenus?
How a god challenged him to a contest on Mt. Celaenae,
◊; page-number 11
and then killed him by cutting him to pieces, like a butcher
slicing up a goat? And now a spring—of his own blood,
they say—wells up from the cave. Or the story of the mother
who was turned to stone, touched to weeping rock, because
it pleased a goddess to kill her children with arrows, one
by one? And the story of Arachne, who shuddered with
terror at Athena's hatred and became a spider? These are
things that happened. The gods did them.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{
And the gods were right to do them. What do
they matter? There's no point in thinking of those things.
Of those destinies, nothing now remains.
  }
  ◊sarpedon{
The spring remains, the mountain, the terror. The
dreams remain. Bellerophon can't take a step without stumbling
on a corpse, an old rancor, a pool of blood, surviving
from those days when it all happened, and things weren't
dreams. In those days his right arm had a weight in the
world, and he killed.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{Then he was cruel too.}
  ◊sarpedon{
He was just, he was merciful. He killed the Chimera.
And now that he's old and exhausted, the gods abandon
him.
  }
  ◊hippolochus{And that's why he roams the countryside?}
  ◊sarpedon{
He's the son of Glaucus and Sisyphus. He fears the
caprices, the ferocity of the gods. He feels himself becoming
a wild animal, and he doesn't want to die. "Boy," he
says to me, "the mockery and treachery is this: first they
strip away your strength and then they despise you for being
less than a man. If you want to live, stop living . . ."
  }
  ◊hippolochus{If that's what he thinks, why doesn't he kill himself?}
  ◊sarpedon{
Nobody kills himself. Death is destiny. All you can
do is want it, Hippolochus.

Meleager's life was linked to a brand which his mother
Althaea drew from the fire when he was born. She was

Listen, Meleager. You're dead now. The flames, the
heat, are things of the past. You're less now than the smoke
that rose from that fire. You're almost nothing. Resign
yourself. For you the things of the world—the morning,
the evening, this place or that—are nothing. Look around
you now.

I don't see anything. What does it matter? I'm an
ember again . . . What did you say about the places in the
world? Oh, Hermes, how lovely and various and sweet a
place the world must be to a god like you! You have a
god's eyes, Hermes. Whereas I was only Meleager, a hunter
and a son of hunters. I never left my native forests, I spent
my life by the hearth, and when I was born my fate was
already contained in the brand my mother pulled from the
fire. A few friends, the wild animals—this was all I ever
knew.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Do you think any man in the world has ever known
anything else?
  }
  ◊meleager{
I don't know. But I've heard of lives that were lived
freely beyond the mountains and the rivers; tales of crossing
the sea, of archipelagoes, of encounters with monsters and
gods. Of men even stronger than I was, younger men,
marked with the sign of strange destinies.
  }
◊; page-number 47
  ◊hermes{
Everyone of them had a mother, Meleager. And labors
to perform. And the same death awaited them all. They all
died of another's passion. None of them was his own master,
or knew anything else.
  }
  ◊meleager{
A mother . . . None of them had a mother like mine.
Nobody knows what it means to know that your life lies in
her hands, and to feel yourself blazing, and those eyes fixed
on the fire. Why did she draw the brand from the fire the
day I was born? Why didn't she let me crumble into ashes?
And I had to grow up, to become Meleager, to cry and
play, go hunting, to watch the winter and the seasons, to
be a man—but always knowing the other thing, carrying
that weight within me, daily seeing my fate in her eyes.
That's what hurts. An enemy is nothing.
  }
  ◊hermes{
You're strange, you mortals. The thing you already know
amazes you. That an enemy is nothing is obvious. He has
a mother too, like anybody else. So why can't you accept
the knowledge that your life lies in her hands?
  }
  ◊meleager{
Hermes, we hunters have an agreement. When we
climb the mountain, each man helps the other. Each holds
the other's life in his hands; he never betrays his friend.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Fool, a friend is always betrayed . . . But that's not it.
Your lives are forever contained in the burning brand, and
your mother draws you from the fire, and you live half
blazing. The passion of which you die is your mother's
passion, smouldering on in you. What are you but her flesh and blood?
  }
  ◊meleager{
It was her eyes, Hermes. You have to have seen those
eyes. Seen them from childhood on, to know them, live with
them, to feel them fixed on your every step, your every
action, for days, for years, and to know that they're getting
old, that they're dying, and to suffer what they suffer, to
hurt yourself by hurting them, to go in terror of offending
them. It's then that their staring at the fire, their watching
the brand as it burns, becomes unbearable.
  }
◊; page-number 48
  ◊hermes{
You know this too, and it surprises you, Meleager? The
fact that those eyes grow old and die means that in the
interval you become a man, and knowing that you offend
them, you go somewhere else in search of them—live eyes,
true eyes. And if you find them—and one always finds them,
Meleager—the person they belong to is again your mother.
And then you no longer know with whom you have to deal,
and you're almost happy. But there's one thing you can be
certain of—they know. Both of them alike, the old she and
the young ones. And no one can escape the fate that has
marked him from birth with the sign of the fire.
  }
  ◊meleager{Has anyone else had my fate, Hermes?}
  ◊hermes{
Everyone, Meleager. Everyone. The same death awaits
them all. They all die of another's passion. In every man's
flesh and blood, his mother rages. True, many men are
cowards, worse cowards than you.

  ◊meleager{I was no coward, Hermes.}
  ◊hermes{
I speak to you as a shade, not as a mortal. So long as a
man doesn't know, he's brave.

I'm no coward now, not here, seeing what I see. I
know many things now. But I don't believe that she—the
young she—knew anything about those eyes.

Atalanta . . . Will she become a mother too? Could
she stare at the fire? Atalanta?

See if you can remember what she said to you, the night
when you killed the boar.
  }
  ◊meleager{
That night. The night of the pact. I haven't forgotten
that night, Hermes. Atalanta was furious because I'd let the
boar escape in the snow. She struck at me with her axe and
hit me on the shoulder. I barely felt the blow, but I burst
out, even angrier than she, "Get back to the house, Atalanta!
Go back with the women! This is no place for your silly
outbursts." And later that evening when the boar was
killed, Atalanta walked beside me, among the other hunters,
◊; page-number 49
and handed me the axe. She'd gone back alone to look for
it in the snow. That evening we made a pact that when we
went out hunting, one of us would take no weapons. That
way the other wouldn't be tempted by anger.
  }
  ◊hermes{And what did Atalanta say?}
  ◊meleager{
I remember clearly, Hermes. "Son of Althaea", she
said, "the boarskin will lie on our marriage-bed. It will be
like your blood-price—yours and mine." And she smiled, as
though asking for forgiveness.
  }
  ◊hermes{
Meleager, no mortal succeeds in thinking of his mother
as a girl. But don't you think the person who could say such
words would be capable of staring at the fire? It was old
Althaea who killed you, for a blood-price.
  }
  ◊meleager{
Hermes, all this is my fate. But surely there must have
been mortals who lived full lives, men whose lives didn't lie
in somebody else's hands . . .
  }
  ◊hermes{
Do you know of any, Meleager? They would be gods.
Oh, a few cowards may have succeeded in hiding, but they
too carried their mothers' blood, and sooner or later the
hatred, the passion, the rage blazed out in their hearts. On
some evening of life even they felt themselves blazing
again. Not all of you, true, have died of this. All of you,
when you know, lead the life of the dead. Believe me,
Meleager, you were lucky.
  }
  ◊meleager{
But not even to see my own children, barely to know
my own bed . . .
  }
  ◊hermes{
You've been lucky. Your children will not be born. Your
bed is empty. Your friends go hunting as they did before
you existed. You are a shade, a nothing.
  }
  ◊meleager{And Atalanta? What about her?}
  ◊hermes{
The house is empty as it used to be when night was
falling and you and the men came home late from hunting.
Atalanta, who drove you to revenge, is not dead. The two
women live together without speaking. They stare at the
◊; page-number 50
hearth where your mother's brother was murdered and
where you became ashes. Maybe they don't even hate each
other. They know each other too well. Without a man,
women are nothing.
