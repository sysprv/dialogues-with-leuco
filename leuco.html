<h1>Dialogues with Leucò</h1>
<h2>Cesare Pavese</h2>
<section id="foreword">
<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p class="intro">Had it been possible, I would gladly have done without all
this mythology. But myth, it seems to me, is a language of
its own, an instrument of expression. There is nothing arbitrary
about it. It is a seedbed of symbolic forms, possessing, like
all languages, its own rage of meanings which can be
conveyed in no other way. When we retell an old myth—a
proper name, an action, a heroic feat—we are expressing, with
the utmost economy of means, a general and comprehensive
fact, a core of reality which quickens and feeds a whole
organic growth of passion and human existence, an entire
conceptual complex. If this mythical name or action also
happens to be familiar to us from childhood, from our
schooldays, so much the better. What is more acutely
disturbing than to see familiar stories troubled into new life?
In these dialogues I have confined myself to Greek
mythology. For obvious reasons these myths have never lost
their popularity; they can count on both an immediate and a
traditional acceptance. At all costs I wanted to avoid
whatever is shapeless, irregular, accidental; even in subject
matter, I wanted to confine myself within a given frame; I
have tried for a concrete, finite presence. A true revelation,
I am convinced, can only emerge from stubborn concentration
on a single problem. I have nothing in common with
experimentalists, adventurers, with those who travel in strange
regions. The surest, and the quickest, way for us to arouse the
sense of wonder is to stare, unafraid, at a single object.
Suddenly—miraculously—it will look like something we have
never seen before.</p>

<h1>THE MOTHER</h1>
<p class="intro">Meleager's life was linked to a brand which his mother
Althaea drew from the fire when he was born. She was
a woman of strong mind, and when Meleager killed his
maternal uncle in a fight over the boarskin, she flew
into a rage, thrust the brand back into the fire, and let
it burn.</p>
<!-- page number 46 -->
<h3 class="dialogue-title">Meleager, Hermes</h3>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> Hermes, I burned like a brand.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> But you can't have suffered much.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> The fury, the passion before—they were worse than
the fire.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Listen, Meleager. You're dead now. The flames, the
heat, are things of the past. You're less now than the smoke
that rose from that fire. You're almost nothing. Resign
yourself. For you the things of the world—the morning,
the evening, this place or that—are nothing. Look around
you now.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> I don't see anything. What does it matter? I'm an
ember again . . . What did you say about the places in the
world? Oh, Hermes, how lovely and various and sweet a
place the world must be to a god like you! You have a
god's eyes, Hermes. Whereas I was only Meleager, a hunter
and a son of hunters. I never left my native forests, I spent
my life by the hearth, and when I was born my fate was
already contained in the brand my mother pulled from the
fire. A few friends, the wild animals—this was all I ever
knew.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Do you think any man in the world has ever known
anything else?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> I don't know. But I've heard of lives that were lived
freely beyond the mountains and the rivers; tales of crossing
the sea, of archipelagoes, of encounters with monsters and
gods. Of men even stronger than I was, younger men,
marked with the sign of strange destinies.</p>
<!-- page number 47 -->
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Everyone of them had a mother, Meleager. And labors
to perform. And the same death awaited them all. They all
died of another's passion. None of them was his own master,
or knew anything else.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> A mother . . . None of them had a mother like mine.
Nobody knows what it means to know that your life lies in
her hands, and to feel yourself blazing, and those eyes fixed
on the fire. Why did she draw the brand from the fire the
day I was born? Why didn't she let me crumble into ashes?
And I had to grow up, to become Meleager, to cry and
play, go hunting, to watch the winter and the seasons, to
be a man—but always knowing the other thing, carrying
that weight within me, daily seeing my fate in her eyes.
That's what hurts. An enemy is nothing.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> You're strange, you mortals. The thing you already know
amazes you. That an enemy is nothing is obvious. He has
a mother too, like anybody else. So why can't you accept
the knowledge that your life lies in her hands?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> Hermes, we hunters have an agreement. When we
climb the mountain, each man helps the other. Each holds
the other's life in his hands; he never betrays his friend.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Fool, a friend is always betrayed . . . But that's not it.
Your lives are forever contained in the burning brand, and
your mother draws you from the fire, and you live half
blazing. The passion of which you die is your mother's
passion, smouldering on in you. What are you but her flesh and blood?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> It was her eyes, Hermes. You have to have seen those
eyes. Seen them from childhood on, to know them, live with
them, to feel them fixed on your every step, your every
action, for days, for years, and to know that they're getting
old, that they're dying, and to suffer what they suffer, to
hurt yourself by hurting them, to go in terror of offending
them. It's then that their staring at the fire, their watching
the brand as it burns, becomes unbearable.</p>
<!-- page number 48 -->
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> You know this too, and it surprises you, Meleager? The
fact that those eyes grow old and die means that in the
interval you become a man, and knowing that you offend
them, you go somewhere else in search of them—live eyes,
true eyes. And if you find them—and one always finds them,
Meleager—the person they belong to is again your mother.
And then you no longer know with whom you have to deal,
and you're almost happy. But there's one thing you can be
certain of—they know. Both of them alike, the old she and
the young ones. And no one can escape the fate that has
marked him from birth with the sign of the fire.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> Has anyone else had my fate, Hermes?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Everyone, Meleager. Everyone. The same death awaits
them all. They all die of another's passion. In every man's
flesh and blood, his mother rages. True, many men are
cowards, worse cowards than you.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> I was no coward, Hermes.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> I speak to you as a shade, not as a mortal. So long as a
man doesn't know, he's brave.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> I'm no coward now, not here, seeing what I see. I
know many things now. But I don't believe that she—the
young she—knew anything about those eyes.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> She didn't know, Meleager. She <em>was</em> those eyes.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> Atalanta . . . Will she become a mother too? Could
she stare at the fire? Atalanta</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> See if you can remember what she said to you, the night
when you killed the boar.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> That night. The night of the pact. I haven't forgotten
that night, Hermes. Atalanta was furious because I'd let the
boar escape in the snow. She struck at me with her axe and
hit me on the shoulder. I barely felt the blow, but I burst
out, even angrier than she, "Get back to the house, Atalanta!
Go back with the women! This is no place for your silly
outbursts." And later that evening when the boar was
killed, Atalanta walked beside me, among the other hunters,
<!-- page number 49 -->
and handed me the axe. She'd gone back alone to look for
it in the snow. That evening we made a pact that when we
went out hunting, one of us would take no weapons. That
way the other wouldn't be tempted by anger.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> And what did Atalanta say?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> I remember clearly, Hermes. "Son of Althaea", she
said, "the boarskin will lie on our marriage-bed. It will be
like your blood-price—yours and mine." And she smiled, as
though asking for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Meleager, no mortal succeeds in thinking of his mother
as a girl. But don't you think the person who could say such
words would be capable of staring at the fire? It was old
Althaea who killed you, for a blood-price.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> Hermes, all this is my fate. But surely there must have
been mortals who lived full lives, men whose lives didn't lie
in somebody else's hands . . .</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Do you know of any, Meleager? They would be gods.
Oh, a few cowards may have succeeded in hiding, but they
too carried their mothers' blood, and sooner or later the
hatred, the passion, the rage blazed out in their hearts. On
some evening of life even they felt themselves blazing
again. Not all of you, true, have died of this. All of you,
when you know, lead the life of the dead. Believe me,
Meleager, you were lucky.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> But not even to see my own children, barely to know
my own bed . . .</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> You've been lucky. Your children will not be born. Your
bed is empty. Your friends go hunting as they did before
you existed. You are a shade, a nothing.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> And Atalanta? What about her?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> The house is empty as it used to be when night was
falling and you and the men came home late from hunting.
Atalanta, who drove you to revenge, is not dead. The two
women live together without speaking. They stare at the
<!-- page number 50 -->
hearth where your mother's brother was murdered and
where you became ashes. Maybe they don't even hate each
other. They know each other too well. Without a man,
women are nothing.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager:</span> Then why did they kill me?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes:</span> Ask why they made you, Meleager.</p>
