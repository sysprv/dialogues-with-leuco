<root><h1>Dialogues with Leucò</h1>
<h2>Cesare Pavese</h2>

<section id="foreword"><h1>Foreword</h1>
<p class="intro">Had it been possible, I would gladly have done without all
this mythology. But myth, it seems to me, is a language of
its own, an instrument of expression. There is nothing arbitrary
about it. It is a seedbed of symbolic forms, possessing, like
all languages, its own rage of meanings which can be
conveyed in no other way. When we retell an old myth—a
proper name, an action, a heroic feat—we are expressing, with
the utmost economy of means, a general and comprehensive
fact, a core of reality which quickens and feeds a whole
organic growth of passion and human existence, an entire
conceptual complex. If this mythical name or action also
happens to be familiar to us from childhood, from our
schooldays, so much the better. What is more acutely
disturbing than to see familiar stories troubled into new life?
In these dialogues I have confined myself to Greek
mythology. For obvious reasons these myths have never lost
their popularity; they can count on both an immediate and a
traditional acceptance. At all costs I wanted to avoid
whatever is shapeless, irregular, accidental; even in subject
matter, I wanted to confine myself within a given frame; I
have tried for a concrete, finite presence. A true revelation,
I am convinced, can only emerge from stubborn concentration
on a single problem. I have nothing in common with
experimentalists, adventurers, with those who travel in strange
regions. The surest, and the quickest, way for us to arouse the
sense of wonder is to stare, unafraid, at a single object.
Suddenly—miraculously—it will look like something we have
never seen before.</p></section>

<h1>I</h1>

<section id="dialogue-the-cloud">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Cloud</h2>
  <p class="intro">It seems likely that Ixion was condemned to Tartarus
because of his presumptions. But that he fathered the
Centaurs on the clouds is false, since the race of Centaurs
already existed at the time of his son's marriage.
The Lapiths and the Centaurs belong to the age
of the Titans, when very different creatures
were still permitted to mate and interbreed. The
result was that swarm of monsters which Olympus
later pursued with implacable hatred.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">The Cloud, Ixion</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Ixion, there is a law and we must obey it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>The law has no power here, Nephele. Here the law is the
glacier, the storm, the darkness. And when at last the
weather clears and you drift softly toward the peak, it's no
time then to be thinking about the law.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>There is a law, Ixion, which didn't exist before. A
stronger hand now masses the clouds.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>That hand doesn't reach here. Look, the weather's clear,
and you're laughing, aren't you? And when the sky turns
black and the wind howls, who cares about the hand that
scatters us like rain? That was what happened in the days
when there was no master. Nothing has changed up here on
the mountains. We're used to all this.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Much has changed on the mountains. Pelion knows
it. Ossa and Olympus know it. Wilder mountains know it
too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>What has changed on the mountains, Nephele?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Not the sun, not the rain, Ixion. Man's fate has
changed. There are monsters. A limit has been imposed
upon you mortals. The rain, the wind, the peak, and the
clouds are no longer yours to possess. You can no longer
hold them in your arms, live with them. Other hands now
hold the world. There is a law, Ixion.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>What law?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>You already know. Your fate, the limit imposed
upon you—</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>I hold my fate in my fist, Nephele. What has changed?
Can these new masters stop me from throwing boulders
for the joy of it? Or from going down to the plain and
breaking an enemy's back? Are they any more terrible than
fatigue and death?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>That's not it, Ixion. You can still do all that, and
more besides. But you can no longer mate with us, the
nymphs of the wind, the goddesses of the earth. Destiny has
changed.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>No longer? What do you mean, Nephele?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>I mean that if you try to do what you once did, you'll
do something terrible. Like a man who tries to embrace a
friend and strangles him, or is strangled himself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>I don't understand. You mean you're leaving the mountain?
You're afraid of me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>I'll be here on the mountain, here and everywhere.
But I'm out of your reach, Ixion. You're powerless against
the rain and the wind. You must bow your head. That's
your only salvation.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>You're afraid, Nephele.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Yes, I'm afraid. I've seen the mountain peaks. But
I'm not afraid for myself, Ixion. I cannot suffer. I'm afraid
for you—you who are only men. These mountains where
you were once the masters, where you used to run, and
these creatures, our children, conceived when we were both
free, now tremble at a nod. We are all the slaves of a
stronger hand. The Centaurs, sons of the wind and the
rain, are hiding in the deep ravines. They know they are
monsters.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>Who says so?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Don't defy that hand, Ixion. It is fate. I've seen
others, more reckless than you or the Centaurs, hurl themselves
from the cliff and not die. Understand me, Ixion.
Death, in which your courage was defined, can be taken
from you, like a blessing refused. Do you know this?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>You've told me so before. What does it matter? We'll
live more intensely.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>You can't be serious. You don't know the immortals.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>I want to know them, Nephele.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Ixion, you think they're presences like us, like Night,
Earth, or old Pan. You're young, Ixion, but you were born
under the old dispensation. For you there are no monsters,
there are only friends. For you death is something that
happens, like day, like night. You're one of us, Ixion. What
you are is what you do, and that is all. But for them, the
immortals, everything you do has a meaning that lingers.
And they probe everything from far off, with their eyes,
their nostrils, their lips. They are immortal and they cannot
live for themselves alone. What you achieve or don't
achieve, what you say, what you search for—all these things
gladden or displease them. And if you offend them—if you
make the mistake of disturbing them on their Olympus
—they swoop down upon you, bringing death—the death
which they know, a bitterness which lasts, which is felt
forever.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>We can still die.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>No, Ixion. They will turn you into a kind of shadow,
a shade that wants to live but never dies.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>Have you seen them, these gods of yours?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>I have seen them . . . Oh Ixion, you don't know
what you're asking.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>I've seen some of them too, Nephele. I don't find them
so terrible.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>I knew it. Your fate is sealed. Which one did you
see?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>How could I tell? It was a young man. He was walking
barefoot through the forest. He passed by me, but didn't
speak. Then he vanished before a cliff. For a long time
I stood there looking for him, too amazed to move. I wanted
to ask him who he was. He seemed to be a creature of flesh,
like you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Is he the only one you saw?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>I saw him again in a dream, with the goddesses. I seemed
to be standing beside them, talking and laughing with them.
And they were telling me the same things that you're saying,
but without fear, without trembling like you. We talked
together of fate and death. We talked about Olympus. We
laughed at the ridiculous monsters—</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>O Ixion, Ixion, your fate is sealed! Now you know
what has changed up there above the mountains. And
you've changed too. And you think you're more than a man.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>I tell you, Nephele, that you're like them. Why shouldn't
I admire them, at least in a dream?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Fool, you can't stop at dreams. You'll climb up to
them, aspire to them. You'll do something terrible. Then
that death of theirs will come.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>Tell me all the goddesses' names.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>You see? Dreaming isn't enough for you now.
You believe in your dream as if it were real. I implore you,
Ixion, don't climb to the top. Think of the monsters and
how they were punished. The same thing will happen to
you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>I had another dream last night. You were in it too,
Nephele. We were fighting the Centaurs. I had a son whose
mother was one of the goddesses—I don't know which. And
he looked like that same young god who was walking
through the forest. He was stronger than me, Nephele. The
Centaurs ran away, and the mountain was ours. You were
laughing, Nephele. You see, even in my dreams, I can
accept my fate.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>Your fate is sealed. No one lifts his eyes to a goddess
with impunity.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ixion: </span>Not even to the Goddess of the Oaks, the Lady of the
Peaks?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">The Cloud: </span>It doesn't matter which, Ixion. But don't be afraid.
I'll be with you till the end.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-chimera"><h2 class="dialogue-title">The Chimera</h2>
<p class="intro">It was with high hearts that the youth of Greece set out
for the East in quest of glory and death. Here their
courage and daring took them through a sea of fabulous
atrocities, in which some of them failed to keep their
heads. There is no point in citing names. Besides, there
were more than seven such Crusades. It is Homer
himself who—in Book VI of the <span class="roman">Iliad</span>—tells us of the
melancholy which consumed the killer of the Chimera
in his old age, and of his young grandson Sarpedon
who died under the walls of Troy.</p>

<h3 class="interlocutors">Hippolochus, Sarpedon</h3>

<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>Ah, there you are, boy.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>Hippolochus, I found your father. He won't hear of
coming home. You should see him. He's a terrible sight—
plodding through the countryside, covered with filth, oblivious
of the weather. He's an old beggar, Hippolochus.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>What do the peasants say about him?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>The Aleian plain is deserted, a wilderness, Uncle.
Reeds and swampland, nothing else. I asked about him in
the valley of the Xanthus, but they hadn't seen him for days.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>What about him? What does he say?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>He has no memory of home or us. Whenever he meets
somebody, he talks to him about the Solymi, of Glaucus,
Sisyphus, and the Chimera. When he saw me, he said, "if
I were your age, boy, I'd go drown myself." He doesn't
threaten the living. "Boy," he said to me, "you're just,
you're merciful. We're just and merciful men. If you want
to stay just and merciful, stop living."</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>Bellerophon bitter? Bellerophon grumbling? I can't
believe it.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>You should hear the terrible threats he makes. He
dares the gods to accept his challenge. Night and day he
keeps on walking. All his rancor, all his bitterness, is lavished
on the dead—or rather on the gods.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>Glaucus and Sisyphus, you mean?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>He says they were punished by treachery. Why wait
until they're old and feeble before ambushing them? "Bellerophon,"
he says, "was just and merciful as long as the
blood coursed in his body. And now that he's old and
alone, why do the gods decide to abandon him?"</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>It's strange that should surprise him. And that he
should blame the gods for something which every living
thing must suffer. But he was always just. What do he and
those dead men have in common?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>Listen, Hippolochus. When I saw those desperate
eyes of his, I too wondered if this was really Bellerophon
I was talking to. Something has happened to your father.
Not just old age. Not just misery and loneliness. Your
father is atoning for the death of the Chimera.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>Are you mad, Sarpedon?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>Your father accuses the gods of injustice because they
wanted him to kill the Chimera. Over and over again he
says, "From the day I stained myself with the monster's
blood, I haven't had a real life. I have looked for men to
fight, tamed the Amazons, slaughtered the Solymi. I ruled
over Lycia and I planted a great garden—but all this was
nothing. Where can I find another Chimera? Where is the
strength of the arms that killed her? Sisyphus and my
father Glaucus were just men, young men—then as they
grew old, the gods abandoned them both, let them become
wild animals and die. How can the man who met the
Chimera resign himself to death?" That's how your father
talks. The man who used to be Bellerophon.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>From Sisyphus, who chained the infant Thanatos,
to Glaucus who fed living men to his mares, our breed
has broken its bounds. But these are men of the past; they
belonged to an age of monsters. The Chimera was the last
monster they knew. Our land is just and merciful now.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>Are you sure, Hippolochus? You think that killing
the Chimera was enough? Our father—I can call him that
—should know. And yet he's as gloomy as a god—some
white-haired old tramp of a god—and he roams through
fields and swamps talking to his dead.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>What is he looking for?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>The arm that killed the Chimera. He wants the pride
of Glaucus and Sisyphus, especially now that he, like them,
has reached the boundary of things, the limit, the end.
Their courage torments him. He knows a second Chimera
will never lie in wait for him among the rocks. And he
defies the gods.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>Sarpedon, I'm his son, but these are things I can't
understand. The earth is just a place now—why can't men
grow old in piece? In a young man, almost a boy like you,
Sarpedon, I can understand the tumult of the blood. But
only in a young man. Only for a just cause. Not revolt
against the gods.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>But he knows what it's like to be young, he knows
what old age is like. He's seen other days. He has looked
at the gods, as you and I look at each other now. He tells
of terrible things.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>Why listen then?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>Oh Hippolochus, who could help listening? Bellerophon
has seen things which don't often happen.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>I know, Sarpedon, I know. But that world is over.
When I was a child, he told me the same stories.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>But there's a difference—he wasn't talking with the
dead in those days. They were only stories then. But now
every destiny he meets becomes his own.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>What did he tell you?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>Things you already know. But what you can't know
is the coldness, the desperation in his eye, like the look of
a man who is no longer anything but who knows everything.
Stories of Lydia and Phrygia, old stories, without
justice, without mercy. You know the story of Silenus?
How a god challenged him to a contest on Mt. Celaenae,
and then killed him by cutting him to pieces, like a butcher
slicing up a goat? And now a spring—of his own blood,
they say—wells up from the cave. Or the story of the mother
who was turned to stone, touched to weeping rock, because
it pleased a goddess to kill her children with arrows, one
by one? And the story of Arachne, who shuddered with
terror at Athena's hatred and became a spider? These are
things that happened. The gods did them.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>And the gods were right to do them. What do
they matter? There's no point in thinking of those things.
Of those destinies, nothing now remains.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>The spring remains, the mountain, the terror. The
dreams remain. Bellerophon can't take a step without stumbling
on a corpse, an old rancor, a pool of blood, surviving
from those days when it all happened, and things weren't
dreams. In those days his right arm had a weight in the
world, and he killed.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>Then he was cruel too.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>He was just, he was merciful. He killed the Chimera.
And now that he's old and exhausted, the gods abandon
him.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>And that's why he roams the countryside?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>He's the son of Glaucus and Sisyphus. He fears the
caprices, the ferocity of the gods. He feels himself becoming
a wild animal, and he doesn't want to die. "Boy," he
says to me, "the mockery and treachery is this: first they
strip away your strength and then they despise you for being
less than a man. If you want to live, stop living . . ."</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hippolochus: </span>If that's what he thinks, why doesn't he kill himself?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sarpedon: </span>Nobody kills himself. Death is destiny. All you can
do is want it, Hippolochus.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-blind">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Blind</h2>
  <p class="intro">Nothing happened in Thebes in which the blind
prophet Tiresias did not play a part. Shortly after this
conversation, the misfortunes of Oedipus began—that
is, his eyes were opened, and he himself dashed them
out in horror.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Oedipus, Tiresias</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>Old Tiresias, must I believe what they say here in
Thebes? That the gods blinded you out of jealousy?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>If it's true that everything comes from the gods, then
you must believe it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>What do <em>you</em> say?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>That there's too much talk about the gods. Being blind
is a misfortune no different from being alive. It is my
experience that disasters strike in their own good time and
strike where they must.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>In that case what do the gods do?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>The world is older than the gods. Before time was born,
the earth was already filling space. It bled, it felt pleasure;
the earth was the only god. In those days things themselves
had power. It was <em>things</em> that happened. Whereas now the
gods turn everything into words, illusions, threats. But the
gods can only make trouble, join things together or pull
them apart. Not touch them, not change them. They came
too late.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>This is no way for a priest to be talking.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>If I didn't know that much, I wouldn't be a priest.
Take the case of a boy who goes swimming in the Asopus.
A morning in summer, say. The boy comes out of the water,
goes back in happily, dives, dives again. Then he gets
cramps and drowns. What do the gods have to do with
this? Should he attribute his death to the gods? Or the
pleasure he had? Neither one. Something has happened—something
which is neither good nor evil, something
which has no name—the gods will give it a name later.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>And to give things names, to explain them, seems to
you a small matter, Tiresias?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>You're young, Oedipus, like the gods. And like them
you explain things by giving them names. You still don't
know that beneath the earth there is rock, and that the
bluest sky is the emptiest. For men like me, for the blind,
all things are a blow. A blow, Oedipus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>And yet you've spent your life in touch with the gods.
You have meditated on the seasons, on human miseries and
pleasures. Men tell many stories about you, as they would
of a god. And one of them so strange, so improbable, that
it must have some kind of meaning—the kind of meaning
that the clouds have perhaps.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>I have lived a long time. I have lived so long that every
story I hear seems to be my own. What meaning do the
clouds have?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>A presence within the emptiness . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>But what is this story which you think has a meaning?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>Have you always been the man you are now, Tiresias?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>Ah, I understand. The story about the snakes. When I
was a woman for seven years. Well, what do you make of
that story?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>It happened to you, and you know it did. But without
a god such things don't happen.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>You think so? On earth anything can happen. There is
nothing which hasn't happened before. In those days I had
feelings of sexual disgust. I felt that my spirit, my sanctity
as a priest, my character, were degraded by sex. When I
saw those two snakes taking their pleasure, making love on
the moss, I couldn't suppress my disgust, I touched them
with my stick. Shortly afterwards I became a woman—and
for years my pride was forced to submit. The things of the
world are rock, Oedipus.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>But is the woman's sex really so vile?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>Not at all. Nothing is vile, except to the gods. There are
irritations, feelings of disgust, and illusions which, when
they reach the rock, vanish. Here the rock was the force of
sex, its ubiquity and omnipresence under all forms and
changes. From man to woman, and vice versa (seven years
later I saw the two serpents again), what I refused to accept
with my spirit was done to me by violence or lust, and I,
proud man or humbled woman, let myself go as a woman
and was passive as a man. And I learned everything about
sex: I reached the point where as a man I looked for men,
and as a woman, looked for women.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>You see? A god has taught you something.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>Above sex there is no god. It is the rock, I tell you.
Many gods are beasts, but the snake is the oldest of all the
gods. When a snake sinks down into the ground—there you
have the image of sex. Life and death are in it. What god
can incarnate and include so much?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>You yourself. You said so.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>Tiresias is old, and he isn't a god. When he was young,
he was ignorant. Sex is ambiguous and always equivocal. It
is an end that seems an everything. Man succeeds in incarnating
it, in living inside it, like a good swimmer in the
water; but meanwhile he has grown old, he has reached
the rock. In the end one idea, one illusion, remains: that the
other sex is satisfied. Well, don't believe it. For all of us
it is wasted effort. I know.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>It isn't easy to refute what you say. It's not for nothing
that your story begins with the snakes. But it also begins
with disgust, and sexual fatigue. What would you say to a
healthy man who swore to you that he had never felt disgust?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>That he isn't a healthy man. He's still a boy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>I have had encounters too, Tiresias, on the streets of
Thebes. And in one of them we talked about man—from
infancy until death—and we too reached the rock. As of
that day I became husband and father, and king of Thebes.
For me in my life, there is nothing ambiguous or wasted.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>You aren't alone, Oedipus, in thinking that. But words
don't reach the rock. May the gods protect you! I too speak
to you, and I am old. Only the blind man knows the darkness.
It seems to me that I live outside time, that I have
lived forever, and I no longer believe in the days. In me too
there is something that feels pleasure and something that
bleeds.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>You were saying that this something was a god. Why,
good Tiresias, don't you try praying to it?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Tiresias: </span>We all pray to some god, but what happens has no
name. The boy who drowns on a summer morning—what
does he know of the gods? What does it help him to pray?
There is a great snake in every day of life, and it sinks down
and watches us. Have you ever asked yourself, Oedipus, why
the unhappy go blind as they grow old?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>May the gods spare me that!</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-mares">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Mares</h2>
  <p class="intro">Hermes, an ambiguous god, between life and death,
between sex and spirit, between the Titans and the gods
of Olympus, is a familiar figure. But how did it come
about that the good doctor Asclepius sprang from a
world where god and beast commingled? That does
require explanation.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Hermes of the dead, Chiron the centaur</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>The gods ask you to rear this child, Chiron. You know
already that the beautiful Coronis is dead. With his own
immortal hands the God snatched the child from her blazing
womb. I was summoned to that poor human body, but
it was already afire—the hair was flaring like chaff. The
shade had left before I came. With a single leap it fled
from the pyre down to Hades.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>They say she became a mare at the moment of death.
Is it true?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>I think so. But her flaring mane and the blazing fire
were so alike, I couldn't be sure. I arrived an instant too
late. I had to rescue the child and bring it here.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>Little boy, you'd be better off if you had stayed in the
fire. All you have of your mother is that poor human body.
Your father is cruel, blinding light, and you must live in a
world of bloodless, anguished shadow, a world of festering
flesh, of fever and sighs: all this comes to you from the
Bright One. The same light that made you will lay bare
the world before you, implacably; everywhere it will expose
sadness, wounds, the vileness of things . . . Snakes will
watch over you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>The world of yesterday has fallen indeed if even snakes
have gone over to the Light. But why did Coronis die, do
you know?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>Lord of the Ways, we shall not see her again as she
was, happy, racing from Didymus to Pelion through the
canebrakes and the rocks. Let that suffice. Words are blood.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Believe me, Chiron, I mourn for her as much as you.
Why the God killed her I don't know. In my own country
of Larissa, they tell of encounters with animals in caves
and the woods . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>What do you expect? We are animals. And even you,
Lord of the Ways, at Larissa you were once bull's sperm.
And in those early days you mated in the slime with all the
shapeless things of blood. You, Hermes, should understand.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>That was long ago, Chiron. Now I live beneath the
earth or at the crossroads. Sometimes I see you and your
brothers bounding down from the hills, like great boulders,
vaulting over the ponds and the gorges, racing and calling.
Your hooves, your animal nature I can understand. But
you're more than that. Look at your arms and your chest,
like a man's chest. And that great human laugh of yours.
And the girl who was killed, and her love for the God. And
her friends who are weeping for her now—you're somehow
different things. Your own mother, surely, didn't a god
enjoy her once?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>Yes, the world has changed since then. The old god
turned into a stallion to approach her. On the peak of the
mountain it was.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Yes, but answer me this. Coronis was a woman. She
walked through the vineyards and she played with the Bright
One till he killed her and burnt her body.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>Hermes, have you ever looked up from Larissa and seen
Mount Olympus profiled against the sky after a night of
wind?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Yes. And gone up there too, sometimes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>So did we once. We galloped up, we raced from ridge
to ridge.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Why don't you go back?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>Coronis went back, Hermes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>That mountain is death. That's what I meant. The new
masters live there. They're not like the masters in the old
days, Cronos or the Ancient One. They're not like us as
we used to be, when we bounded among things like the
things we were. In those days wild beasts and swamp brought
gods and men together. We were mountain and horse, plant
and cloud and running water, we were everything then,
everything on earth. Who could die in those days? What was
bestial then, if the beast was in us like the god?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>You have girls, Chiron, and they are mortal women or
mares, as they please. Why complain? Here you centaurs
have the mountain, the plain, the seasons. There is everything
here you could ask for, even human houses, huts, and
villages down there by the mouth of the valley, and stables
and firesides where poor mortals tell tales about you and
are always glad to welcome you. Don't you think the world
is governed better by the new masters?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>You're one of them and you take their side. But once
you were bull sperm and bestial rage, Hermes. Now you
lead the bloodless shades down to the world below. What
are men but shadows before their time? But I'm happy to
think that the child's mother leapt down on her own. If
she found nothing else, she found herself as she died.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Now I know why she died. She climbed the slopes of
the mountain, she was a woman and she gave the God such
love that she bore his child. The God has no pity, you say.
But do you really think Coronis left her animal desires
behind her in the swamps? Did she leave behind the shapeless
frenzy of the blood which spawned her?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>Of course she didn't. What then?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>The new gods of Olympus are always smiling, but there's
one thing at which they do not smile. Believe me, I've seen
destiny. Whenever chaos spills over into the light, into
their light, then they must strike down and destroy and
remake. That is why Coronis died.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>But they can't remake Coronis. I was right when I told
you that Olympus is death.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>But the Bright One loved her. If he were not a god he
would have mourned her. He snatched the child from her
body—he gives it to you joyfully. He knows that only you
can make a true man of him.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>I have already told you what his fate will be in the
homes of men. He will be Asclepius, the lord of bodies, a
man-god. He will live among festering flesh and sighs. Men
will turn to him to escape their fate, to hold back by one
night, by a single instant, the pains of death. This little
child will walk between life and death, like you, Hermes,
who once were bull sperm and now are only the guide of
the shades. This is what the Olympians have in store for
mortal men.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>But isn't it better for men to die like this than come
to that ancient damnation, to mate with beast or tree, to
become lowing bull or crawling snake, to become eternal
rock or weeping spring?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Chiron: </span>Yes. So long as Olympus is heaven. But Olympus too
shall pass.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-flower"><h2 class="dialogue-title">The Flower</h2>
<p class="intro">This act of exquisite infamy, insufficient in itself to turn
us against a spring god like Apollo the Lucid, must
have been witnessed by Leopardi's two divinities, Eros
and Thanatos. This is clear as sunlight.</p>

<h3 class="interlocutors">Eros, Thanatos</h3>

<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>Were you expecting this, Thanatos?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>From an Olympian I expect anything. But not that
it would end like this.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>Mortals, luckily, will call it an accident.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>It isn't the first time and it won't be the last.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>And in the meantime Hyacinth is dead. His sisters are
already mourning for him. The useless flower that was
flecked by his blood now everywhere stars the valleys of the
Eurotas. It's spring, Thanatos, and this boy won't see it.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>Wherever an immortal has been, these flowers bloom.
But in the past there was at least some pretext, an attempt
to escape or an offense of some sort. They struggled against
The god or were guilty of some wickedness. It was that way
with Daphne and with Actaeon. But Hyacinth was only a
boy. He lived his life doing honor to his master. He played
with the god the way a child plays. He was excited, bewildered.
You know this, Eros.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>Mortals are already saying it was an accident. No one stops
to think that the Bright One rarely misses.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>All I saw was his frowning smile as he followed the
flight of the discus and watched it come down. He threw it
high into the sun, and Hyacinth looked up and raised his
hands and waited for it, dazzled. Why did this happen,
Eros? You surely must know.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>What can I say, Thanatos? I can't be moved to pity by a
god's whim. And you know as well as I do that when a god
approaches a mortal, something cruel always happens. It
was you who spoke of Daphne and Actaeon.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>But what happened this time?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>A whim, as I said. The Bright One wanted to play, he
came down among men and he saw Hyacinth. For six days
he lived in Amyclae, six days which changed Hyacinth's
whole life and reshaped the world for him. Finally, the lord
wanted to go away and Hyacinth looked at him, bewildered.
So the discus fell and struck him between the eyes.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>Maybe Apollo didn't want him to cry.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>No, the Bright One doesn't know what crying is. We know
it, though, we young gods and daemons who were alive
when Olympus was still bare rock. We have seen many
things, we have seen even trees and stones weep. But the
lord is different. Six days, a life—they're all the same to
him. No one knew this better than Hyacinth.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>Did he really know these things? Didn't he perhaps
think of the god as a model, an older friend, a brother he
trusted and looked up to? I only saw him when he raised
his arms to play the game—there was nothing in his eyes
but trust and awe. No, Hyacinth didn't know who the
Bright One was.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>Perhaps, Thanatos. Perhaps he didn't even know about
Actaeon and Daphne. It's hard to tell where fear stops and
trust begins. But certainly he spent six days of intense
experience.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>What do you think he really felt?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>What every young person feels. But this time the center
of his thoughts and actions was too much, too much for a
boy. He was with the stranger everywhere; wherever the
god was, he was—where men wrestled, in the rooms of the
palace, beside the Eurotas, talking to him, listening to him.
He listened to the god's stories about Delos and Delphi,
about Typho and Thessaly and the land of Hyperboreans.
One thing is certain, the god said nothing of his
home on Olympus, of the other immortals, of divine things.
No, he talked about himself and his sister, about the Graces,
in the way people talk of ordinary life: wonderful, but ordinary.
Sometimes they listened together to a wandering poet
who was staying for the night.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>Nothing wrong in all this.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>Nothing indeed, very reassuring. Hyacinth learned that
the lord of Delos, with those indescribable eyes and his
quiet way of speaking, had seen and experienced things
which might happen someday to him. The god spoke of
him too and of his fate. The everyday life of Amyclae was
an open book to him. He made plans for the future, he
treated Hyacinth like an equal, like someone of his own
age, and the names of Aglaia, Eurynome, and Auxo, distant
smiling women, young women, who had lived with the god
in strange intimacy—he spoke their names casually, calmly,
with an idle relish that made Hyacinth shiver. This was
how the boy lived, and felt. When he was with the god,
everything seemed easy and clear. He felt he could do anything.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>I've known other men too. Men of experience, wiser,
stronger than Hyacinth. And every one of them was destroyed
by this craving to do everything.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>But in Hyacinth it was only hope, a trembling hope of
becoming like the stranger. But the god refused the enthusiasm
he read in the boy's eyes—it was enough to arouse
it. What he saw in his eyes and his curly hair was the
beautiful purpled flower that was Hyacinth's fate. He paid
no attention to words or tears—he had come to see a
flower. And this flower had to be worthy of him, something
at once wonderful and ordinary, like the memory of the
Graces. So, tranquilly, he created the flower.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>We are ferocious things, we immortals. I wonder how
long the Olympians will make destiny. They dare everything:
that may destroy them too.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>Who can tell? From the time of chaos, there has been
nothing but blood. Men's blood, blood of monsters, of gods.
We begin and we die in blood. How do you think you were
born, Thanatos?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>In order to be born, a thing must die: even men know
that. But the Olympians don't know it, they've forgotten it.
In a world that passes, they endure. They don't exist, they
<em>are</em>. Their every whim is a fatal law. To express a flower, they
destroy a man.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>Yes, Thanatos. But shouldn't we take into account the
richness of feeling which Hyacinth experienced? That
tremulous hope in which he died was also his birth. He was
a boy, his mind was still fresh and unformed, still muffled
in the early mists of childhood, the son of Amyclas, the
unimportant king of an unimportant country—what would
he have been without the stranger from Delos?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>A man among men, Eros.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>I know. And I know too that no one escapes his fate.
But it's not my way to be moved by a god's whim. Hyacinth
lived six days in the shadow of a light. He lacked
nothing—he knew perfect joy, he knew its rapid, bitter end.
Which is something that the Olympians and the immortals
do not know. What more could he ask, Thanatos?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Thanatos: </span>That Apollo should weep for him, as we do.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Eros: </span>You ask too much, Thanatos.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-lady-of-the-beasts">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Lady of the Beasts</h2>
  <p class="intro">The love of Artemis and Endymion was, I am sure,
chaste. This, of course, does not mean that the less
energetic of the two was not avid to shed blood. There
was obviously nothing gentle about the character of the
virgin goddess: mistress of wild beasts, she sprang from
that horde of indescribable divine mothers spawned
by the monster-haunted Mediterranean. As for Endymion,
we know that someone who cannot sleep longs to
sleep and passes into legend as the eternal dreamer.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Endymion, A Stranger</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Listen, you're a stranger, I can talk to you. Don't be
frightened if my eyes look mad. Those beggar's rags wrapped
around your feet are no prettier than my eyes. And yet you
look the sort of man who could settle down in the village of
his choice and find shelter and work and make a home
there. If you've stayed on the road, I'm certain it's because
the only thing you have is your own fate. Here it is, barely
dawn, and you're already on the move. That's because you
like to be awake when things are just coming out of the
dark, still untouched. You see that mountain? Latmos,
they call it. I've climbed up there a good many times at
night, in the pitch of dark, and waited among the beech trees
for dawn. And yet I feel that somehow I have never touched
the mountain.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Who ever feels he's touched the things around him?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Sometimes it seems to me that we're like the wind
going by, untouchable. Or like the dreams we have when
we're asleep. Do you like to sleep by day, stranger?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>I sleep any time. When I feel tired I go to sleep.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>You're a man who walks the roads. Tell me, when
you're asleep, do you hear the brushing of wind, and birds,
and ponds, the rustling sounds, the way the water talks?
Don't you find you're never more alone than when you're
asleep?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>I don't know, friend. I've always lived alone.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Sleep no longer gives me rest. I think I've always
slept, but I know this isn't so.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>You look strong and healthy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>I am, stranger, I am. Sleep after wine and that heavy
sleep by a woman's side—I know what they're like, but
they don't help. When I'm in bed I'm tense, ready to leap
up at any moment. Look at my eyes, they're the eyes of a man
who stares into the dark. I feel as though I'd always lived
like this.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Have you lost someone you love?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span><em>Someone?</em> Oh stranger, what do you take us for?
Mortals?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Is it a friend who died?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Much, much more than any friend. Stranger, when
I climb Mt. Latmos I am no longer mortal. Don't look at
my eyes! I'm not crazy. And I know it's not a dream. It's
so long since I slept. You see the dark patches the beech
trees make on the mountain? Last night I was up there,
waiting. Waiting for her.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Who were you waiting for?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>We mustn't speak her name. Don't speak her name.
She has no name—or has many. Friend, you're a man,
you know the shiver of terror you have at night when suddenly
a kind of clearing opens before you in the forest? No,
you don't. Or how at night you remember the clearing you
passed through during the day: you saw a flower there, or a
kind of berry swaying in the wind—and this flower, this
berry, became something wild, something untouchable,
mortal, there among all the wild things? Do you know
what I mean? A flower like a wild beast? Tell me, friend,
have you ever looked at the privates of a she-wolf, a doe, or
a snake? Looked with horror and desire?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>At the sex of a beast?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>More, more than that. Have you ever known someone
who was many things in one, who brought them with her,
so that everything she did, every thought of her seems to
contain the whole infinity of things of which your countryside,
your sky consists, and memories and days gone by
you'll never know, and days to come, and certainties, another
countryside, another sky forever alien—have you ever
known such a person, stranger?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>I have heard of such things.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>And if this being were the wild beast, the savage
thing, the untouchable nature that no man may name?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>These are fearful things you speak of.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Yes, but there's more, even more. You're listening,
and you should. If you walk the roads, you know that divinity
and terror are everywhere on this earth. If I talk to you,
it's because we both, travelers and strangers, have something
divine about us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>I have seen many things. And some of them were terrible
things. But there's no need to leave home. Remember—I
don't know if this will help—there are gods in the
fireplace too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Good, you understand. You'll believe me then. I had
fallen asleep one evening on Latmos, propped against a
tree. It was dark—I'd been wandering late. The moon was
shining when I woke. In my dream I felt a shiver of dread
at the thought of being there, in the clearing, in the moonlight.</p>
  <p class="following">Then I saw her. I saw her looking at me, looking at me
with that sidelong glance of hers. But her eyes were steady,
clear, with great deeps in them. I didn't know it then, nor
even the next day, but I was already hers, utterly hers,
caught within the circles of her eyes, in the space she filled,
the clearing, and the hill. She smiled at me, timidly. "Lady,"
I said to her, and she frowned, like a girl, like a shy, wild
thing, as though she understood that I was amazed, somehow
dismayed, to find myself calling her Lady. The dismay
I felt then was always between us.</p>
<p class="following">Then she spoke my name and stood beside me—her tunic
barely reached her knees—and stretched out her hand and
touched my hair. There was something hesitant in the way
she touched me, and she smiled, an incredible, mortal
smile. I thought of all the names men call her by, and I
would have fallen to my knees but she held me up, as one
holds up a child, by putting her hand under my chin. Look
at me, I'm a grown man. And she was just a wild thing, a
slight awkward girl. Except for her eyes, those eyes of hers.
I felt like a small boy. "You must never wake again," she
said. "Don't try to follow me. I'll come to you again." And
she went off through the clearing.</p>
  <p class="following">I walked all over Latmos that night, until dawn. I followed
the moon everywhere, through the gorges and the
scrub, up to the peaks. I listened, listened, and all I could
hear was her voice, like the sound of sea water, a hoarse
voice, cold and maternal. Every rustle, every shadow stopped
me. I caught glimpses of wild animals, running. When the
light came—a livid, veiled light—I looked down on the
plain, on this road where we're walking now, and I knew
that my home was no longer among men. I was no longer
one of them. I was waiting for the night.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>I find this hard to believe, Endymion. I mean, you've
gone back to the mountain, and yet you're still alive, you're
still a man, and the Wild One, the lady of many names,
hasn't made you hers.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>I <em>am</em> hers, stranger.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>I mean . . . Do you know the story of that prying
shepherd who was torn to pieces by his dogs, the stag-man?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Stranger, I know everything about her, everything.
We talk and talk, and I pretend to be asleep, always, all
those nights, and I never touch her hand, any more than
one would touch a lioness or the green water of a pond or
the thing that is nearest and closest. She stands there before
me, a slight, unsmiling girl, looking at me. And those great
transparent eyes have seen other things. They still do see
them. They <em>are</em> those things. Wild berry and wild beast
are in her eyes, and the howling, the death, the cruelty of
flesh turned stone. The shed blood, the savaged flesh, the
ravenous earth, the wilderness—all this I know. For her,
the Wild One, this is wilderness, and loneliness. For her the
beasts are wilderness. Her caresses are like the caresses you
give to a dog or a tree. But she <em>looks</em> at me, stranger, she
<em>looks</em> at me—a slight girl standing there in a tunic, like a
girl from your own village.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>But haven't you ever talked with her about your life
as a man?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Stranger, you've seen terrible things. You must know
that the beast and god together blot out the man.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>True, when you climb Mt. Latmos you are no longer
mortal. But immortals know how to live alone, and you
refuse loneliness. You require the animal encounter, the
touch of sex. When you're with her, you pretend to be
asleep. What do you want of her?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>I want her to smile once more. And then let me spill
my blood on the ground at her feet, my flesh torn by her
hounds.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>And what does she say?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Nothing. She looks at me. At dawn she goes and
leaves me alone. And I look for her among the beech trees.
The daylight wounds my eyes. "You must never wake
again," she said to me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Oh mortal man, the day you truly waken you'll know
why she spared you her smile.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>I know now. Stranger, you speak like a god.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Godlike and terrible presences course the world, and
we walk the roads. You said that yourself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Oh wanderer god, her sweetness is like dawn, or like
earth and heaven revealed. It is godlike. But for others, for
things and beasts alike, she laughs—briefly. She commands—and
her command annuls. And no one has ever touched
her knee.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Mortal heart, resign yourself. No one has touched her,
neither god nor man. Her voice, that harsh maternal voice
of hers, is all she can give you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>And yet—</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>And yet?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>So long as that mountain stands, I will not sleep in
peace.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Everyone has his own kind of sleep, Endymion. Your
sleep is infinite with the cries and the voices of things, it is
full of earth and sky and day following day. Sleep your
sleep bravely, you have nothing better. The loneliness, the
wild places of earth are yours. Love them as she loves them.
And now, Endymion, I must leave you. You will see her
tonight.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Endymion: </span>Oh wanderer god, I thank you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Stranger: </span>Farewell. But you must never wake again, remember
that.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-sea-foam">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">Sea Foam</h2>
  <p class="intro">Britomart, the Cretan and Minoan nymph, is mentioned
in Callimachus. That Sappho was a Lesbian from Lesbos
is regrettable, but far sadder is the dissatisfaction which
made her throw herself into the Aegean sea. This sea
is full of islands and it was on the most easterly of them,
Cyprus, that Aphrodite the wave-born came to land.
It was a sea that knew many tragic stories. Ariadne,
Phaedra, Andromache, Helle, Scylla, Io, Cassandra,
Medea—who does not remember their names? They all
passed that way and some of them stayed there. Those
waters, one might say, were drenched in sperm and tears.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Sappho, Britomart</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>It's boring here, Britomart, the sea is boring. You've
been here for ages, aren't you sick of it?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>You liked being alive better, I know. To become a
curl of frothing wave isn't enough for you mortals. And yet
men seek death, this death. Why did you drown yourself,
Sappho?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I didn't know it was like this. I thought everything
ended with that final jump. I thought the longing and the
restlessness and the tumult would all be done with. The sea
swallows, the sea annuls, I thought.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Everything dies in the sea, and comes to life again.
You know now.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>But you, Britomart, you were one of the nymphs. What
did you want from the sea?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>From the sea? Nothing. I lived on the mountains. A
man pursued me and I ran away. You don't know our woods,
Sappho, how tall they are. The mountain falls away sheer,
and the sea way below . . . I jumped, to save myself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>To save yourself? But why?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>To get away from the man who was pursuing me. To
be myself. I had to, Sappho.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>Had to? Was he horrid?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>I don't know, I didn't see him. All I knew was that
I had to get away.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>But why? I mean, to leave your daily life, the hills and
the fields? To leave the earth and become sea foam—all
this because you <em>had to.</em> Had to <em>what?</em> Surely all this meant
something to you, weren't these things part of you too?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>But Sappho dear, it was desire and longing that made
you what you are now. And yet you blame me for running
away.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>You weren't mortal, you knew that there is no escaping.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>But I didn't try to escape from desire, Sappho. I have
what I desire. I was a nymph of the rocks, now I am a sea
nymph. This is how we're made. Our life is leaf and trunk,
spring water, sea foam. We play with the surface of things,
we don't run away from them. We change. This is our
desire, this is our destiny. Our one terror is that a man
should possess us, catch us. That would be the end of
everything. You know Calypso?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I've heard of her.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Calypso let herself get caught by a man. And nothing
could help her any more. For years she never left her cave.
They all came, Leucothea, Callianeira, Cymodoce, Oreithyia,
Amphitrite . . . They spoke to her, they carried her off
and saved her. But it took years; and first the man had to go.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I can understand Calypso. But I don't understand why
she listened to you. If she'd really been in love, how could
she have given way?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Oh Sappho, mortal wave, will you never learn what
it is to smile?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I knew when I was alive. And I went in search of death.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>But that's not smiling, Sappho. Smiling means living
like a wave, like a leaf, accepting your fate. It means dying
in one form and being reborn in another. It means accepting—accepting
oneself, accepting fate.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>And did you accept, Britomart?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>I ran away, Sappho. It's easier for the nymphs . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I knew how to run away too, when I was alive. My way
was to look into things, into the tumult, and turn it into
speech, into song. But fate is something quite different.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Why, Sappho? Fate is joy, and when you sang your
song you were happy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I was never happy, Britomart. Desire is not song. It
destroys, and burns, like a snake, like the wind.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>But have you ever known mortal women who lived
peacefully in desire and tumult?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>None. Wait, yes, perhaps . . . But not mortal women
like Sappho. You were still a mountain nymph, I wasn't yet
born, when a woman crossed this sea, a mortal woman, who
lived always in storm and strife. Perhaps she was in peace.
She killed, destroyed, blinded. She was like a goddess—always
herself, unchanging. Perhaps she didn't even have to
smile. She was lovely, no fool, and around her there was
nothing but fighting and death. Men fought and died for
her, Britomart, asking only for her name to be joined to
theirs for a moment, for her name to be given to their living
and dying. And they smiled for her. You know her—Helen,
the daughter of Leda.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>And she, was she happy?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>At least she didn't run away, that much is certain. She
was sufficient unto herself. She didn't ask what her fate was.
Whoever had the will—and the strength—carried her off.
For ten years she followed a hero; they took her away from
him and married her to another man. He too lost her, countless
men fought for her across the seas. Then the second
man took her back and she lived with him, at peace. She
was buried, and in Hades she knew even more men. She lied
to no one, she smiled at no one. Perhaps she was happy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>And you envy this woman?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I envy no one. I wanted to die. It's not enough for me
to be someone else, and if I can't be Sappho, I would sooner
be nothing.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Then you accept your fate?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I don't accept it. I <em>am</em> my fate. Nobody accepts his fate.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Nobody except us. We who know how to smile.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>What's so hard about that? It's part of your fate. But
what does it mean?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>It means accepting, and accepting oneself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>Yes, but what does it <em>mean?</em> How can you accept a force
that seizes you and turns you into desire, into shuddering
desire that struggles over a body, a man's or a girl's, like
the foam between the rocks? And this body rejects you and
crushes you, and you fall and long to embrace the rock, to
accept it. Sometimes you are the rock yourself, and the foam
and the tumult are twisting at your feet. No
one is ever at peace. How can one accept all this?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>You have to accept it. You tried to run away, Sappho,
and where are you now? A bit of frothing wave.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>But don't you feel it, Britomart, this langour, this deep
tidal unrest? Everything here is torn and tormented endlessly.
Even dead things go on struggling.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>You should know the sea, Sappho. You came from
an island.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>Oh Britomart, even when I was a child it frightened
me. That ceaseless life is monotonous, sad . . . There are no
words for the weariness of it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Once in my island I saw people coming and going.
There were women like you, Sappho, women who lived for
love. They never looked sad or tired to me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>I know, Britomart, I know. But did you follow them
on their journeys? There was one woman who hanged herself
from her own roof beam in a foreign land. And one
who woke up one morning on a rock, abandoned. And the
others, so many others, from all the islands and all the lands
who went down to the sea. Some were enslaved, some were
tortured, some killed their own children. There were some
who toiled night and day, and some who never touched
solid land again and became things, creatures of the sea.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>But Helen—she came out unscathed, you said?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>Sowing fire and slaughter. She smiled at no one, she lied
to no one. She was a woman worthy of the sea. But Britomart,
do you remember who was born over there?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Who do you mean?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>There is one island you've never seen. Every morning
when the sun rises, it touches this island first.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Oh Sappho.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>It was there she sprang from the sea, the goddess who
has no name, the tormented, restless one who smiles to
herself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>But she doesn't suffer. She is a great goddess.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>And everything that is torn and tortured in the sea is
her substance and her breath. Have you seen her, Britomart?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>Oh Sappho, don't ask me. I'm only one of the little
nymphs.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Sappho: </span>You must have seen her, then?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Britomart: </span>In her presence we all run away. Don't speak of her,
child.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-mother">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Mother</h2>
  <p class="intro">Meleager's life was linked to a brand which his mother
Althaea drew from the fire when he was born. She was
a woman of strong mind, and when Meleager killed his
maternal uncle in a fight over the boarskin, she flew
into a rage, thrust the brand back into the fire, and let
it burn.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Meleager, Hermes</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>Hermes, I burned like a brand.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>But you can't have suffered much.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>The fury, the passion before—they were worse than the fire.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Listen, Meleager. You're dead now. The flames, the
heat, are things of the past. You're less now than the smoke
that rose from that fire. You're almost nothing. Resign
yourself. For you the things of the world—the morning,
the evening, this place or that—are nothing. Look around
you now.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>I don't see anything. What does it matter? I'm an
ember again . . . What did you say about the places in the
world? Oh, Hermes, how lovely and various and sweet a
place the world must be to a god like you! You have a
god's eyes, Hermes. Whereas I was only Meleager, a hunter
and a son of hunters. I never left my native forests, I spent
my life by the hearth, and when I was born my fate was
already contained in the brand my mother pulled from the
fire. A few friends, the wild animals—this was all I ever
knew.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Do you think any man in the world has ever known
anything else?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>I don't know. But I've heard of lives that were lived
freely beyond the mountains and the rivers; tales of crossing
the sea, of archipelagoes, of encounters with monsters and
gods. Of men even stronger than I was, younger men,
marked with the sign of strange destinies.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Everyone of them had a mother, Meleager. And labors
to perform. And the same death awaited them all. They all
died of another's passion. None of them was his own master,
or knew anything else.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>A mother . . . None of them had a mother like mine.
Nobody knows what it means to know that your life lies in
her hands, and to feel yourself blazing, and those eyes fixed
on the fire. Why did she draw the brand from the fire the
day I was born? Why didn't she let me crumble into ashes?
And I had to grow up, to become Meleager, to cry and
play, go hunting, to watch the winter and the seasons, to
be a man—but always knowing the other thing, carrying
that weight within me, daily seeing my fate in her eyes.
That's what hurts. An enemy is nothing.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>You're strange, you mortals. The thing you already know
amazes you. That an enemy is nothing is obvious. He has
a mother too, like anybody else. So why can't you accept
the knowledge that your life lies in her hands?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>Hermes, we hunters have an agreement. When we
climb the mountain, each man helps the other. Each holds
the other's life in his hands; he never betrays his friend.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Fool, a friend is always betrayed . . . But that's not it.
Your lives are forever contained in the burning brand, and
your mother draws you from the fire, and you live half
blazing. The passion of which you die is your mother's
passion, smouldering on in you. What are you but her flesh and blood?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>It was her eyes, Hermes. You have to have seen those
eyes. Seen them from childhood on, to know them, live with
them, to feel them fixed on your every step, your every
action, for days, for years, and to know that they're getting
old, that they're dying, and to suffer what they suffer, to
hurt yourself by hurting them, to go in terror of offending
them. It's then that their staring at the fire, their watching
the brand as it burns, becomes unbearable.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>You know this too, and it surprises you, Meleager? The
fact that those eyes grow old and die means that in the
interval you become a man, and knowing that you offend
them, you go somewhere else in search of them—live eyes,
true eyes. And if you find them—and one always finds them,
Meleager—the person they belong to is again your mother.
And then you no longer know with whom you have to deal,
and you're almost happy. But there's one thing you can be
certain of—they know. Both of them alike, the old she and
the young ones. And no one can escape the fate that has
marked him from birth with the sign of the fire.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>Has anyone else had my fate, Hermes?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Everyone, Meleager. Everyone. The same death awaits
them all. They all die of another's passion. In every man's
flesh and blood, his mother rages. True, many men are
cowards, worse cowards than you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>I was no coward, Hermes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>I speak to you as a shade, not as a mortal. So long as a
man doesn't know, he's brave.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>I'm no coward now, not here, seeing what I see. I
know many things now. But I don't believe that she—the
young she—knew anything about those eyes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>She didn't know, Meleager. She <em>was</em> those eyes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>Atalanta . . . Will she become a mother too? Could
she stare at the fire? Atalanta?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>See if you can remember what she said to you, the night
when you killed the boar.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>That night. The night of the pact. I haven't forgotten
that night, Hermes. Atalanta was furious because I'd let the
boar escape in the snow. She struck at me with her axe and
hit me on the shoulder. I barely felt the blow, but I burst
out, even angrier than she, "Get back to the house, Atalanta!
Go back with the women! This is no place for your silly
outbursts." And later that evening when the boar was
killed, Atalanta walked beside me, among the other hunters,
and handed me the axe. She'd gone back alone to look for
it in the snow. That evening we made a pact that when we
went out hunting, one of us would take no weapons. That
way the other wouldn't be tempted by anger.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>And what did Atalanta say?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>I remember clearly, Hermes. "Son of Althaea", she
said, "the boarskin will lie on our marriage-bed. It will be
like your blood-price—yours and mine." And she smiled, as
though asking for forgiveness.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Meleager, no mortal succeeds in thinking of his mother
as a girl. But don't you think the person who could say such
words would be capable of staring at the fire? It was old
Althaea who killed you, for a blood-price.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>Hermes, all this is my fate. But surely there must have
been mortals who lived full lives, men whose lives didn't lie
in somebody else's hands . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Do you know of any, Meleager? They would be gods.
Oh, a few cowards may have succeeded in hiding, but they
too carried their mothers' blood, and sooner or later the
hatred, the passion, the rage blazed out in their hearts. On
some evening of life even they felt themselves blazing
again. Not all of you, true, have died of this. All of you,
when you know, lead the life of the dead. Believe me,
Meleager, you were lucky.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>But not even to see my own children, barely to know
my own bed . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>You've been lucky. Your children will not be born. Your
bed is empty. Your friends go hunting as they did before
you existed. You are a shade, a nothing.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>And Atalanta? What about her?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>The house is empty as it used to be when night was
falling and you and the men came home late from hunting.
Atalanta, who drove you to revenge, is not dead. The two
women live together without speaking. They stare at the
hearth where your mother's brother was murdered and
where you became ashes. Maybe they don't even hate each
other. They know each other too well. Without a man,
women are nothing.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Meleager: </span>Then why did they kill me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hermes: </span>Ask why they made you, Meleager.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-friends">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Friends</h2>
  <p class="intro">There is no point in doing Homer over again. My purpose
is simply to report a conversation that took place on
the eve of Patroclus' death.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Achilles, Patroclus</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>Patroclus, why is it that when men want to encourage
themselves they always say: "I've seen worse than this."
What they should say is: "There's worse to come. A day
will come when we are corpses."</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Achilles, I don't recognize you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>I recognize you, though. It takes more than a drop of
wine to down Patroclus. This evening I know that when all
is said and done there's no difference between us and the
common run of men. There is a worst for all of us. It's the
last thing to come and it stuffs your mouth like a fistful of
earth. Oh, it's all very well to be able to say, "I've seen this,
I've suffered that," but isn't it unjust that when the cruelest
thing of all comes, we can't even remember it?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Well, at least one of us will be able to remember for
the other. That way we'll fool destiny.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>That's why men drink at night. Has it ever occurred
to you that a child doesn't drink because for him death
doesn't exist? Did you drink when you were a boy, Patroclus?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Everything I've done has been done with you. And as
you would do it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>What I mean is, when we were always together, playing
and hunting, and the day was short but the years never
passed, did you know then what death was, your death? A
boy can kill himself, but he doesn't know what death is.
Then suddenly comes the day when you understand, death
is inside you, and from that moment on you're a grown man.
You fight and dice, you drink, you wish the nights away.
But have you ever seen a boy drunk?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>I wonder when I was first drunk. I don't know, I can't
remember. It seems to me that I've always drunk, that I
never knew what death was.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>You're like a boy, Patroclus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Ask your enemies about it, Achilles.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>I will. But for you death doesn't exist. And the man who
doesn't fear death is not a good soldier.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>And yet I'm with you tonight, drinking.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>But haven't you any memories, Patroclus? Don't you
ever say: "I've done this, I've seen that," and asked yourself
what you've really done, what sort of life you've led,
what mark you have left on the world? What good is it to
live if we leave no memories behind us?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>When we were boys together, Achilles, we remembered
nothing. Just being together all day was enough.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>Does anyone in Thessaly still remember those days,
I wonder? And when this war is over and our comrades go
home, who will walk the streets we used to walk, who will
know that we were once boys there too—two boys no different
from any others there now? Do the boys who are
growing up there know what's waiting for them?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>A boy doesn't think of such things.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>So many days still to dawn which we shall never see.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Yes, but haven't we seen a good many already,
Achilles?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>No, Patroclus, not so many! The day will come when
we are corpses. When our mouths will be stuffed with a
fistful of earth. And we won't even know what we've seen.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Why think of these things?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>How not think of them? A boy's like an immortal, he
looks and laughs. He doesn't know what things cost. He
doesn't know the sweat and the bitterness. His fighting is
a game. He throws himself down on the ground and plays
dead, then he laughs and goes on with the game.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>But we have other games. Women and plunder. The
enemy. And our drinking together at night. Achilles, when
are we going back to the fighting?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>We're going back, you can be sure of that. A destiny
awaits us. When you see ships on fire, that will be the
moment.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Not till then?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>Does waiting frighten you? Haven't you seen worse
than this?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>The waiting gets on my nerves. We came here to finish
it off. Why not tomorrow?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>There's no hurry, Patroclus. Let the gods say Tomorrow.
It's only for them that what has been will be.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>But whether or not we can say, I've seen worse than
this—that depends on us. To the very end. So drink,
Achilles. Drink to the spear, drink to the shield. What has
been will be again. We'll go back to the fighting, the danger.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>I drink to mortal men and to the immortals. To my
father and my mother. To what has been, the things we
remember. And to the two of us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Do you have so much to remember?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>No more than an old servant or a beggar. They've been
young too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>You're rich, Achilles, and for you wealth is just a rag
to be thrown away. It's only a man like you who can compare
himself to a beggar. You, the man who stormed the
citadel of Tenedos and tore the girdle of the Amazon and
fought with bears on the hills. What other child was tempered
by his mother on the fire? You are sword and spear,
Achilles.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>Except for the fire, you've always been with me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>As the shadow after the cloud. As Pirithous with
Theseus. One day, Achilles, perhaps you too will come down
to Hades, to rescue me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>It was better when there was no Hades. When we wandered
through the forests and by the streams and washed
the sweat off our bodies, when we were boys . . . Every
gesture, then, every motion, was a game. We were memory
and no one knew it. Were we brave? I don't know, it doesn't
matter. I know that on the centaur's mountain it was summer,
it was winter, it was all of life. We were immortal.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>And then the worst came. Danger came, and death.
And we left for Troy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>There's no escaping fate. I never saw my son. Even
Deidamia is dead. Oh why did I ever leave the island with
the women?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Your memories would have been poor then, Achilles.
Better to suffer than never to have lived.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>But how could I tell that life was to be like this? Oh
Patroclus, this is what it is. We had to see the worst.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Tomorrow I'm going out to the fighting. With you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>No, my day hasn't yet come.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Then I'll go alone. And to put you to shame, I'll take
your spear.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>I wasn't born when they cut down the ash to make it.
I wonder if the clearing in the woods is still there.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Come and fight, and you'll see that your spear is
worthy of you. An enemy for every stump.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>The ships aren't burning yet.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>I'll take your greaves and your shield. It will be like
having you beside me. Nobody will be able to touch me.
It'll be a kind of game.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>You really are like a boy that drinks, Patroclus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>When you were a boy, Achilles, running with the
centaur, you didn't think of your memories. And you were
no more immortal than you are tonight.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Achilles: </span>Only the gods know destiny and live. But you play at
destiny.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Patroclus: </span>Another drink, Achilles. Then tomorrow, perhaps in
Hades, I shall say, "Drink again, Achilles."</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-road">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Road</h2>
  <p class="intro">Everyone knows that after Oedipus had defeated the
Sphinx and married Jocasta, he discovered who he
was by questioning the shepherd who had saved him on
Mt. Cithaeron. It was then that the prophecy that
he was to kill his father and marry his mother was
proved true. So Oedipus put out his eyes in horror
and went away from Thebes and died a beggar.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Oedipus, a Beggar</h3>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>I am not a man like other men, friend. I have been
condemned by fate. I grew up on the mountains. The sight
of a mountain or a tower excited me—or a town seen in the
distance as I walked along in the dust. And I didn't know I
was searching for my fate. These days I no longer see anything,
and the mountains tire me. Everything I do is destiny.
Do you understand?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>I'm old, Oedipus, and I've seen my share of destinies.
But don't you think other people—even slaves, hunchbacks,
cripples—would have liked to be the king of Thebes like you?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>But that's not it, I tell you. My troubles go further back,
to the time before I was born, when I might still have been
a man like other men. But no, there was that destiny of
mine. I had to end up at Thebes. I had to kill that man.
Father those children. What's the point of doing something
that was as good as done before you were born?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>There is a point, Oedipus. It's our fate, that's point
enough for us. Leave the rest to the gods.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>There are no gods in my life. My fate is crueler than
the gods. I was ignorant, as all men are ignorant. I wanted
to do good, I wanted to find some good—what, I didn't
know—something to console me in the nights, a hope of
doing something more tomorrow. Even the wicked can hope
for that. But suspicion followed me everywhere, vague
rumors, threats. At first it was only an oracle, an ill-omened
word, and I hoped to escape. I lived all those years like a
fugitive, looking behind me. I dared believe only in my own
thoughts, in the instants of truce, in the unforeseen awakenings.
It was like an ambush. I was always on the alert. And
I didn't escape. It was precisely at that instant that my fate
fulfilled itself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>But Oedipus, it's the same for us all. This is what a fate
means. Not that you haven't suffered terribly.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>No, you don't understand. That's not it. I'd rather my
sufferings had been far worse. I'd rather have been the lowest
man on earth if only I could have willed what I did. Not
merely suffered it when I wanted to do something else.
What is Oedipus, what are all men on earth if our most
secret desire already stirs in the blood before we were born,
if everything has been spoken already?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>Even you, Oedipus, have surely known a few days of
happiness. I don't mean when you overcame the Sphinx
and all Thebes acclaimed you or when your first son was
born, or when you sat in state among your councillors. Of
course, you can't let yourself think of things like that. All
the same, you've lived the life we all live. You were young,
you saw the world, you laughed and joked and talked—like
the wise man you were. You've enjoyed things, waking and
sleeping and walking the roads. You're blind now, yes. But
you've seen better days, Oedipus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>I'd be a fool to deny it. And my life has been a long
one. But I tell you again: I was born to rule over you, to be
king. To a sick man even the finest fruit tastes foul. And
my sickness is destiny—the fear, the perpetual horror of
doing precisely the thing you're fated to do. I knew, I've
always known, that I was like the squirrel who thinks he's
climbing up his cage when he's only making the treadmill
turn. And I ask myself: who is Oedipus?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>And you can answer: a great man. That's how people
used to talk about you in the streets of Thebes. And there
was a man who left home and traveled about Boeotia and
saw the sea and went to Delphi to consult the oracle—all
this to achieve the same fate as you, Oedipus. Your fate was
so exceptional, you see, that it altered other people's. But
what about the man who's always lived in the same village,
done the same job every day, had the usual children, the
usual festivals, and dies at the same age as his father of
the usual trouble?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>I know I'm not a man like other men. But I also know
that the lowest slave, the village idiot, if he knew what his
life was going to be like would loathe even the poor pleasure
it affords. And those poor devils who wanted to achieve my
fate—do you think they escaped their own?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>Much can happen in a man's life, Oedipus. I myself
was one of those men. I left home and traveled all over
Greece. I consulted the oracle at Delphi and reached the
sea. What I wanted was an encounter, to make my fortune,
to meet the Sphinx . . . I knew you were happy in your
palace at Thebes. I had my health then. And even if I
didn't meet the Sphinx and no oracle had spoken of me,
I've enjoyed the life I made for myself. You were my oracle,
you transformed my life, my fate. Beggar or prince, what's
the difference? Both of us have lived. Leave the rest to
the gods.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>You'll never know if what you've done is what you
really wanted. But certainly there's something human,
something uniquely human, in walking the open road. Tortuous,
lonely, it is an image of the sorrow that eats us away.
A sorrow which is almost relief, like rain after heat: so still,
so tranquil that it seems as though it welled up from things,
from the depth of the heart. This fatigue, this peace, after
all the uproar of our destiny—they're perhaps the only
things that are truly our own.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>There was a time when we didn't exist, Oedipus. That
means that even the deepest desires of our heart, our blood,
our moments of awakening, have sprung from nothing. Even
your desire to escape destiny is perhaps destiny. It isn't we
who made our own blood. It's enough to feel it and live
like free men, as the oracle bids us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>Yes, as long as a man is still searching. You had the
luck never to reach your goal. But the day comes when you
go back to Cithaeron, you forget everything and the mountain
seems to bring back your childhood. You look at it day
after day and maybe you climb it. Then someone tells you
that you were born up there. And everything crumbles.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>I understand, Oedipus. But we all have a mountain
which is part of our childhood. And however far away we
wander we always find ourselves walking its paths again.
There we were made what we are.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>Talking is one thing, friend, suffering another. But
certainly talking brings a kind of comfort to the heart. Like
walking the roads day and night as we do, with no goal in
sight. Not like the travels of young men seeking their fortune.
And you, you have talked a lot and seen a lot: did
you really want to be king?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>Who knows? What I do know is that I had to change,
to become something else. You look for one thing and find
something quite different. But talking helps us find ourselves.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>You have a family? Anyone at all?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>A family? I wouldn't be what I am.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>Strange. To understand our neighbor we have to get
away from him. And it's only with strangers, in chance
encounters, that we really speak the truth. That's the way
I should have lived—I, Oedipus, along the roads of Phocis
and the Isthmus, when I still had my eyes. And not climbing
mountains, not listening to oracles . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>But there's one encounter you've forgotten, Oedipus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Oedipus: </span>Which, friend?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Beggar: </span>The encounter at the crossroads. When you met the
Sphinx.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-mountain"><h2 class="dialogue-title">The Mountain</h2>
<p class="intro">In world history, the era named after the Titans was
peopled with men and monsters and with gods not
yet organized on Olympus. But some people believe
that only monsters existed then—that is, intelligences
enclosed in misshapen animal bodies. Hence the
suspicion that many of the monster-killers, beginning
with Heracles, shed kindred blood.</p>

<h3 class="interlocutors">Heracles, Prometheus</h3>

<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Prometheus, I've come to free you.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>I was expecting you. I'm very grateful. You've had
a long and fearful journey. But you don't know the meaning
of fear.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>You're much worse off than I was, Prometheus.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>You really don't know what fear is? No, I don't
suppose you do.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>If fear is not doing what you ought to do, then I've
never known fear. But I'm a man, and sometimes I'm not
sure what I ought to do.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Man is pity and fear. Nothing else.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Prometheus, you keep me here talking, and every moment
that passes your torture continues. I've come to set
you free.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>I know, Heracles. I knew when you were still only
a baby in swaddling clothes, I knew before you were even
born. But I'm like someone who has suffered a great deal—in
prison, in exile, from some danger. When the moment
comes for him to go, he can hardly bring himself to leave
the place where he's suffered so much.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>You mean you don't want to leave your rock?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>I must leave it, Heracles—I said I was expecting
you. But this is a hard moment, as hard for me as for the
man in prison. You know this is a place of suffering?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>I can tell that by looking at you, Prometheus.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>You suffer till you want to die. One day you will
climb your own mountain and you will know this too. But
I cannot die. For that matter, you won't die either, Heracles.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>What do you mean?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>A god will lift you up. Or rather a goddess.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>I wouldn't know, Prometheus. Here, let me untie you.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Yes, you'll be like a baby, overflowing with gratitude
and love. You'll forget your labors and Hera's cruelty
and spend your days praising the gods for their wisdom and
goodness.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Why not? Doesn't everything we have come from
them?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Oh Heracles, there's a wisdom more ancient than
theirs. The world is old, older than this rock. Even they
know that. Everything has a destiny. But the gods are young,
almost as young as you are.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Aren't you a god too?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>I will be someday. So destiny wills. But once I was
a Titan and I lived in a world without gods. Yes, there was
such a world. Can you imagine it, Heracles?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>It was a world of rocks and mountains.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Every man has his rock—that is why I love men.
It's only the gods who don't yet know the rock. They
don't know how to laugh or cry. They smile at destiny.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Who nailed you here, Prometheus? Tell me that.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Oh Heracles, the victor is always a god. So long as
the Titan-man struggles and endures, he can laugh and cry.
And if they nail you here, or you climb your mountain, that
is the victory that fate allows you. We should be grateful
for this. What is a victory but pity turned gesture, saving
others at your own expense? Everyone works for others,
under the law of destiny. Even I, Heracles, if I am freed
today, owe it to someone.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>I've had harder tasks than this, Prometheus. Besides,
I haven't freed you yet.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>I'm not talking about you, Heracles. You're brave
and compassionate. But you've already done your job.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>I haven't done anything, Prometheus.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>You wouldn't be a man if you knew what was destined.
But you live in a world of gods, and the gods have
taken this knowledge from you too. You know nothing and
you've already done everything. Remember the centaur.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>The beast-man I killed this morning?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Monsters can't be killed. Not even the gods can
do that. A day will come when you'll think you've killed a
second monster, far less human than the first, and all you'll
have done is prepare your rock. Do you know who you
struck down this morning?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>A centaur.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>It was Chiron you killed, the good, compassionate
Chiron, friend of Titans and men.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Oh Prometheus . . .</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Don't be troubled, Heracles. Our fates are fused.
By the world's law, no one goes free unless another's blood
is shed for him. The same will happen with you, on Mt.
Oeta. And Chiron knew this.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>You mean he sacrificed himself?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>What else? Just as once I knew that the theft of
fire would mean my rock.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Let me untie you, Prometheus. Then you can tell me
all about Chiron and Mt. Oeta.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>I'm free already. I could be released only if someone
took my place. Chiron let himself be struck down by you;
and you were sent by fate. But in this world born of chaos
there is a law of justice. Pity, fear, and courage are only
its instruments. Whatever is done must one day recur. The
blood which you have shed, which you will shed will drive
you up to Oeta to die your own death there. It will be the
blood of the monsters which you now live to destroy. And
the pyre you mount will burn with the fire I stole.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>But you told me I couldn't die.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Death entered this world with the gods. You mortals
fear death because you know that the gods, by being gods,
are immortal. But everyone has the death he deserves. Their
day will come too.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>What do you mean, Prometheus?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Not everything can be explained. But always remember
that monsters do not die. What dies is the fear they
inspire. So with the gods: when men no longer fear them,
they will vanish.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>And will the Titans return then?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Rocks and forests don't return. They are. What
has been will be.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>And yet you Titans were changed by the gods. You too,
Prometheus.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>Titan is a name, nothing more. Understand me,
Heracles. The world has its seasons, like the fields, like the
earth. Winter returns, summer returns. How can we say
that the forest dies, or remains the same? Before long, men
will be the Titans.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>We mortals?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Prometheus: </span>You mortals—or immortals. The name doesn't
matter.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-inconsolable">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Inconsolable</h2>
  <p class="intro">Sex, drunkenness, and blood always evoked the world
below and, to a select few, gave promise of a blessèd
life among the dead. But the Thracian Orpheus—singer,
voyager to Hades, and victim, torn to pieces like
Dionysus himself—promised even more.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Orpheus, Bacchante</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>This is how it happened. We were climbing the path
through the Forest of Shadows. Cocytus, the Styx, Charon's
skiff, and the screams of the damned were far behind us.
Reflected on the leaves I could just make out the first
glimmer of the sky. But I was still down there in Hades,
and that chill was still with me. I was thinking that someday
I would have to go back down, that what has been will be
again. I was thinking of my life with her, how it had been
before; someday it would have to finish again. What has
been, will be. I was thinking of that cold, of that emptiness
I had passed through and which she was carrying with her
in her bones, in her marrow, her blood. Was it worth the
anguish of coming back to life? I was thinking of this, when
I saw the first glimmer of the light. Then I said, "Let's
finish it once and for all." And I turned around. Eurydice
disappeared like a snuffed candle. All I heard was a faint
squeal, like a mouse skittering to its hole.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>A strange story, Orpheus. I can barely believe it.
People here used to say that you were loved by the gods
and the Muses. And like me, many Bacchantes follow you
because they know you're in love and unhappy. You were
so much in love that you alone among men have gone
through the gates of nothingness. No, I don't believe you,
Orpheus. It isn't your fault if destiny misled you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Destiny has nothing to do with it. My destiny does not
mislead. It's absurd that after such a journey, after looking
nothingness in the face, I should have turned around on a
sudden impulse, or by mistake.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>Here they say you did it for love.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Nobody loves the dead.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>And yet you mourned her, wandering the mountains
and hills—searching for her, calling her. You went down
into Hades. Wasn't that love?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>You claim to see things like a man. Then you must
know that there's nothing a man can do with death. The
Eurydice I mourned was a season of life. I was looking down
there for something very different from my love. I was looking
for a past which Eurydice knows nothing of. I understood
this among the dead while I was singing my song. I
saw the shades stiffen and stare vacantly, heard the lamentation
stop. Persephone hid her face, and Hades himself, the
inscrutable lord of the shadows, leaned forward like a mortal
man and listened. I understood that the dead are nothing.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>Grief has distracted your mind, Orpheus. Who
wouldn't want his past again? Eurydice was almost reborn.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Reborn for what? Only to die all over again, Bacchante.
To carry in her blood the horror of Hades and to tremble
at my side night and day. You don't know what nothingness
is.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>Through your singing you had recovered the past.
But instead you rejected it and destroyed it. No, I can't
believe it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Listen, Bacchante. Only in my song was the past real.
No sooner had I started on the way back than that past
vanished away, became memory, tasted of death. When I
saw the first flicker of light, I jumped for joy like a child,
barely believing it. It was joy for myself, selfish joy, joy for
the world of the living. The season I had been searching
for was there in that glimmer of light. The woman following
me no longer mattered. My past was that first glimmer of light,
it was the song, and the morning. And I turned around.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>I can't believe it, Orpheus. How could you have endured
such a loss? Those who saw your face when you came
back were frightened. For you Eurydice was a season of life.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Nonsense. When Eurydice died, she became something
else. The Orpheus who went down into Hades was no longer
either husband or widower. The grief I felt at the same time was
like the grief of a child—you smile when you remember it.
That season is over. When I wept, I was no longer looking
for her, but for myself. For a fate, if you like. I was listening
to myself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>Many of us follow you because we believe in your
sorrow. Have you misled us then?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Oh Bacchante, Bacchante, why won't you understand?
My destiny does not mislead. I was looking for myself. What
else can one look for?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>We're simple people, Orpheus. Here we believe in
love and death; we laugh and feel sorrow with others. Our
most joyful festivals are those in which blood flows. The
women of Thrace are not afraid of things like this.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>If life is all you know, everything is beautiful. But once
you've been among the dead . . . Believe me, you can't say
that.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>You weren't like this once. You didn't use to talk
about nothingness. It's the encounter with death that makes
us like gods. It was you yourself who taught us that ecstasy
confounds life and death and makes us more than human
. . . You've seen the festival.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>It isn't the blood that matters, girl. Ecstasy and blood—these
things aren't enough. A man's fate is not so easily
defined. You don't know the answer, Bacchante.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>You'd be nothing without us, Orpheus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>I've never denied that. What does it matter? I went
down to Hades without you . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>You went there to look for us—</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>But I didn't find you there. I wanted something very
different. Something I found when I returned to the light.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>There was a time when you sang of Eurydice on the
mountains—</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Time passes, Bacchante. The mountains are still there,
Eurydice isn't. These things have a name, and their name
is man. Invoking the gods of your rite is no help here.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>You once invoked them too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>In life a man does everything. Believes everything. He
even believes that his own blood runs in the veins of others.
Or that what has been can be undone. He believes his ecstasy
can shatter fate. I know all this, and it is nothing.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>You don't know what to make of death, Orpheus,
and yet death is your only thought. There was a time when
our rite made us immortal.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Go on then, enjoy your rite. Only your ignorance makes
it possible. Everyone must descend at least once into his
own private hell. The ritual of my destiny ended in Hades,
when I sang, as only I have the right to sing, of death and
life.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>You say your destiny doesn't mislead. What do you
mean?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>I mean that it's inside you, the fact of your being,
deeper than blood, beyond all ecstasy. No god can touch it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>Perhaps, Orpheus. But we aren't looking for Eurydice.
So why tell us that we all must go down to hell?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Every time you invoke a god, you meet death. And you
go down to Hades to bring something back, to violate a
destiny. You don't defeat the darkness, and you lose the
light. You're torn apart, like a man possessed.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>You're evil, Orpheus . . . You mean you lost the
light?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>I was almost lost, and then I sang. By comprehension
I found myself.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>If that's the price, is it worth it? There's a simpler
way, the way of ignorance and joy. The god is like a lord,
midway between life and death. You yield to his ecstasy,
you're torn to pieces and you tear others to pieces. And
we're reborn, Orpheus, every time, and we waken—like you
when you returned to the light.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Don't talk of daylight, of waking. Few men know.
Women like you don't know what it is.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>Maybe this is why the women of Thrace follow you.
For them you're like the god. You came down from the
mountains. You sing songs of love and death . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Fool. But at least I can talk to you. Perhaps someday
you'll be like a man.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>So long as the women of Thrace—</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Orpheus: </span>Yes?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bacchante: </span>Don't tear the god to pieces.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-werewolf">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Werewolf</h2>
  <p class="intro">Zeus changed Lycaon, lord of Arcadia, into a wolf
as punishment for inhumanity. But the myth does
not say where and how Lycaon died.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">1st Hunter, 2nd Hunter</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>It's not the first time an animal's been killed.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>But it's the first time we've killed a man.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>That's not our worry. The dogs flushed him. It's none
of our business who he was. When we saw him turn at bay
against the rocks, splashing in the mud, his white fur splattered
with blood and his fangs redder than his eyes—who
worried then about who he was and the old stories? He died
savaging the javelin as though it were a dog's throat. Had
the heart of an animal as well as the hide. It's been a long
time since a wolf that size has been seen in these woods.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span><em>I</em> worried about it. I remembered who he was. People
were talking about him when I was a boy. Incredible
stories of what happened when he was human—how he
tried to murder the Lord of the Mountain. His pelt was
the color of trampled snow—he was old, gray, a phantom—and
his eyes were the color of blood.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>What's done is done. Let's skin him and get back
down to the valley. Think of the feast they'll give us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>Let's leave at dawn. We'll make a fire tonight to
keep ourselves warm. The dogs will watch the corpse.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>It isn't a corpse, it's a carcass. But we'd better skin
him now, or he'll be hard as a rock tomorrow.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>What do you think? Should we bury him after we
skin him? He was a man once. It's his animal blood that's
soaked the ground. And once he's skinned, there'll be nothing
left but a little naked pile of bone and flesh—like an
old man's or a child's.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>He's old all right. He was a wolf before there were
men in these mountains. He was older than the lichens on
the trees. Who remembers now that he had a name, was
somebody? If you ask me, he should have died a long time
ago.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>But can we leave his body unburied? This was
Lycaon. He was a hunter like us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>Anyone of us could meet his death up here on the
mountain and nobody but the rain or the buzzards would
ever find him. If he was really a hunter, he met a bad end.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>He fought like an old man, with his eyes. But you
don't really believe he was ever a man, do you? You don't
believe he had a name. If you did, you wouldn't want to
insult his corpse. You'd know that he too dishonored the
dead, that he too lived brutally and cruelly—and this was
why the Lord of the Mountain turned him into a wild
animal.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>They say he roasted men alive.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>I know men who've done much less, and except for
howling and skulking in the forest, they're wolves. Are you
so sure of yourself that you don't sometimes feel a Lycaon
in you? Most of us have days when, if a god touched us,
we'd howl and tear out the throat of anyone who got in our
way. The only thing that saves us is waking up and finding
we have hands and a mouth and human speech. But for
him there was no escape—he left the eyes and the homes of
men behind him forever. Now that he's dead, let him lie in
peace.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>Peace wasn't what he wanted. Peace for him was
curling up among the rocks and howling at the moon. I've
lived in the woods long enough to know that wild things
have no terror of the holy: animals look at heaven only
to yawn, the trees rustle their leaves. And in one respect,
they're like gods: they have no sense of guilt.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>To hear you talk, being a wolf is a fine fate.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>I wouldn't know whether it's fine or not, but I do
know this—I never heard of a plant or an animal that
wanted to turn into a human being. Whereas these woods
are full of men and women who were touched by divinity
and became bush or bird or wolf. No matter how evil they
were or what crimes they committed, their hands were
cleansed of blood, they were freed from guilt and hope,
they forgot they were humans. Isn't that what it is to be a
god?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>A punishment is a punishment. But it removes the
sinner's hopes and fears, and makes destiny of his remorse.
Even if the animal has no memory of the past and lives
solely for his prey, for death, the thing he was remains.
Over there on the hill old Callisto lies buried. Who remembers
what her crime was now? The lords of the sky punished
her severely. Think of it. A beautiful woman, they say she
was, turned into a growling, sobbing bear. She was afraid
of the dark and wanted to go home. There's an animal that
had no peace. Her son came and killed her with his lance,
and the gods didn't move a finger. Some say the gods repented
later and turned her into a tangle of stars. But the
body remained, and that was buried.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>And so? I know the old stories too. It wasn't the
gods' fault if Callisto didn't know how to accept her fate.
It's like someone who wears mourning to a feast, or gets
drunk at a funeral. If I were a wolf, I'd be a wolf even in
my sleep.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>Because you don't know the way of the blood. The
gods add nothing, take nothing away. All they do is touch
you lightly—and nail you where you are. What once was
wish or choice, you find is fate. That means becoming a
wolf. But something of you remains, the you who ran from
the house, the old Lycaon in us all.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>You mean that Lycaon suffered like a man when
the dogs sank their teeth in his throat?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>He was old, on his last legs. You said just now that
he couldn't defend himself. While he was dying there on
the rocks, unable to speak a word, I thought of those poor
old beggars and how they stop short just outside the gate
while the dogs strain at their leashes trying to get at them.
This is something we've seen even here. Admitted, he lived
like a wolf. But when he died and looked at us, he knew he
was a man. His eyes said he was.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">1st Hunter: </span>Friend, the last thing he saw was men hunting him
down. Do you think it matters to him whether he rots underground,
like a man?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">2nd Hunter: </span>There's a peace beyond death. A common lot. It
matters to the living, it matters to the wolf in us all. It was
our fate to kill him. The least we can do is honor custom,
and leave the insults to the gods. Let's go home with clean
hands.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-guest">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Guest</h2>
  <p class="intro">Phrygia and Lydia were countries about which the Greeks
liked to tell terrible stories. There can be no doubt
that they all took place in Greece, but that was in earlier
times.
<br/>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
No need to say who won the reaping contest.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Lityerses, Heracles</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>Here's the field, stranger. Don't think of leaving. We
know what hospitality is as well as you Greeks. You're our
guest and we want you to stay on here. You've eaten with
us, you've drunk our wine, and now these fields of ours will
drink your blood. There'll be a bumper crop in the Meander
Valley next year.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>You must have had quite a number of killings in these
fields?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>Oh, a fair number. But nobody with a build like yours.
We won't need anyone but you this year. Your skin's as
ruddy as fresh-turned earth, and your eyes are like flowers.
You'll fertilize these fields all right.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Who taught you this practice of yours?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>This is the way it's always been. If a man doesn't feed
the earth, why should the earth feed him?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>This year's crop looks like a splendid one. The wheat
stands as high as the reaper's shoulders. Who was the
victim?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>We couldn't get any foreigners last year. So we had to
make do with an old slave and a goat. It was flabby blood.
The earth barely felt it. Look how thin the ears are. Before
cutting up the body, we have to sweat him in the sun till
he comes to a lather. And that's why we're going to put you
to work, reaping and bringing in the sheaves until you're
running with a sweat. And then, at the last minute, when your
blood is boiling pure and foaming like a living thing—that's
the moment when we'll slit your throat. Yessir. You're a
strong young man.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Your gods approve of this practice?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>Above this field there are no gods. There is only the
earth, the Mother, the Cave. She's always waiting, and she
comes to life when the blood streams down to her. Tonight
you'll go down to her cave, stranger.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Don't any of you Phrygians ever visit the cave?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>We leave it when we're born—there's no hurry about
going back.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>I think I understand. Then you manure your gods with
human blood?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>Not the gods, stranger. The earth is our god. Don't
you worship the earth where you live?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Our gods aren't underground. They rule the sea and
the earth, the forest and the cloud, as a shepherd keeps his
flock or a master governs his servants. They live apart, on
the mountains, like the thoughts you see in a man's eye
when he speaks to you, or like the clouds in the sky. They
don't demand blood.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>Stranger, I don't understand. For us the cloud and the
mountain and the cave all have the same name, they're all
one. The blood the Mother has given us we give back to
her in our sweat and death and dung. You must come from
a long way off, stranger. Those gods of yours don't make
sense.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Their breed is immortal. They have conquered the
forest, and the earth and its monsters. As for men like you
who feed the earth with blood, they have driven them down
to the cave.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>I'm not saying your gods don't know their business.
They must have fed the earth with a lot of blood too. Besides,
no famished earth ever brought forth a man like you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Lityerses, shall we start reaping?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>You're a strange fellow. You know, this is the first
time anyone ever said that to me. Aren't you afraid of dying
among the windrows? I suppose you think you'll run off
through the furrows like a squirrel or a quail?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>If I understand you, this isn't dying; it's a return to the
mother, a guest's gift of friendship. All these peasants
sweating in the fields will hail the man who gives his blood
for them. They'll offer him songs and prayers. It's a great
honor.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>Say, stranger, thanks. That slave we killed last year
didn't talk like that, I can tell you! He was an old man, on
his last legs, but we had to tie him up with withies anyway.
Even so, he thrashed about trying to dodge the sickles for
so long that he'd lost all his blood before he fell.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>That won't happen this time, Lityerses. But when
you've killed the poor man, what do you do with him?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>His flesh is hacked off while he's still alive. And then
we scatter the pieces over the fields to waken the Mother
and touch her into life. We wrap the head in sheaves and
flowers, then we sing and dance and throw it into the
Meander. She's cloud and running water too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>You're a wise man, Lityerses, and I can see why you're
king of the fields at Celaenae. But how about Pessinus? Are
there killings there too?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>They kill people everywhere, stranger. Our wheat can
only grow from earth which has been touched to life. The
earth is a living thing. She too must be fed.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>But why do you always kill strangers? Surely the earth,
the cave from which you came, would sooner take back its
own, wouldn't it? Don't you like the bread and wine from
your own fields best?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>You know, I like you, stranger. You might almost be
one of us. But ask yourself why we endure the sweat and
the toil of working these fields. To live—right? Well then,
it's only fair that we stay alive and enjoy the harvest, and
let the other people die. But I suppose you wouldn't know.
You're no peasant.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>But wouldn't it be even better to find a way of putting
an end to the killings and letting everyone, strangers and
your own people alike, enjoy the harvest? Wouldn't it be
better to have one last killing which of itself would make
the earth and the clouds and the strength of the sun forever
fruitful?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>You're no countryman, anyone can see that. Why, you
don't even know that every solstice the earth begins anew,
and the year in its course wears everything away.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>But there must be someone who's been nourished,
from generation to generation, by the sap of every season,
someone so rich and strong and full-blooded that he could
at one stroke renew the earth forever?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>You make me laugh, stranger. You know, you might
almost be talking about me. My family's the only one in
Celaenae that's been here for generations. I'm the king here,
and you know it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Yes, you're the man I had in mind, Lityerses. So let's
start reaping. I came from Greece for this deed of blood.
We'll reap, Lityerses, and tonight you'll go down to the
cave.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>You want to kill me? On my own field?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>I want to fight you. To the death.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>You sure you can handle a sickle, stranger?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Heracles: </span>Don't worry, Lityerses. Let's get going.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lityerses: </span>You know, stranger, you look strong . . .</p>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Hey, look what you're doing. You've got to sprinkle over
this way, towards the sea. That's where the rain comes
from.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>If it rains in one place, does it rain everywhere? Even at
Thespiae? Even at Thebes? They don't have any sea at
Thebes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>But they've got pastures, stupid. That's why they have
wells. They've lit bonfires tonight too.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>And what about after Thespiae? And after that? Where the
people live who walk all night and all day and never get out
of the mountains? I've heard that it doesn't ever rain up
there.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>There are fires burning everywhere tonight.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>Why isn't it raining now? They've kindled the fires.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Because it's a holiday, son. Rain would put the bonfires
out. Wouldn't do anyone a drop of good. It'll rain tomorrow.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>And it's never rained on the bonfires while they were still
burning?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Who knows, son. They were lighting these bonfires long
before you or I were born. Same night every year. Come
to think of it, there <em>was</em> one time when it did rain on the
bonfire. Or so they say.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>It really did?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Yes, but it was a long time ago. People were better than
they are now, and even kings' sons were shepherds in those
days. This whole country looked like a threshing floor then,
threshed neat and clean, and it did what king Athamas told
it to do. People worked and lived their lives, they didn't
have to hide the young goats from the landowners. One
year, they say, the August dog days brought a spell of heat
so bad that the fields and the wells dried up and the people
were dying. They lit the bonfires, but it didn't do a bit of
good. So Athamas took counsel. But he was an old man,
and he'd married a young wife not so long back. She ordered
him around, the way those young women do. And
she kept telling him that this was a time for strong measures
if he didn't want to lose credit. I suppose you want to know
why they didn't pray and sprinkle water? Well, they did.
Why didn't they sacrifice a calf and a bull, lots of bulls?
Well, they did. And what happened? Nothing, that's what.</p>
  <p class="following">So they had to sacrifice his sons. Not his sons by her.
No sir. He didn't have any sons by her. No, these were two
grown-up sons by his first wife—they worked out in the
fields all day long. Well, Athamas, the crazy fool, decided
to do it. Go get them, he said. But the kings' sons aren't so
stupid, you know. So they took off. Then what? Well, as
soon as some god heard what was happening, he sent the
rain clouds down. And the minute the boys took off, those
clouds disappeared. The next thing was that witch of a wife
of his was saying, "You see! I told you so. The clouds were
piling up already. We've got to kill some one." Well, she
kept on like this till the people decided to take Athamas
and burn him alive. They made the bonfire and lit it. They
brought in Athamas, tied up and covered with flowers like
a sacred ox. But suddenly, just when they were about to
throw him on to the fire, the sky turned black. Thunder and
lightning, and then the rain came flooding down. The harvest
was saved. The rain put out the fire, and what do you
think that old fool Athamas does? He forgives them all,
even his wife. Look out for women, son. It's easier to tell a
snake from his missus than know what's going on in a
woman's mind.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>But what happened to the king's sons?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Never heard of again. But two young fellows like that
will always make out.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>But if men were good in those days, dad, why did they
want to burn the two boys?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Because it was August, silly. You don't know what the
real dog days are like. But I know them, and your grandfather
knew them. Compared to them, winter's nothing.
Winter's rough, sure, but you always know it's doing the
crops good. Not the dog days. The dog days mean drought.
Everything dies, and thirst and hunger do things to a man.
A man who hasn't eaten wants to pick a fight. And don't
forget that in those days people got along with each other.
Everyone had his bit of land, they were decent, prosperous
people. Then suddenly the wells go dry, the wheat burns up,
people go hungry and thirsty. Before long they turn into
wild animals.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>Then they must have been bad.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>No worse than we are. The dog days are our masters
now, and there's no rain can set us free from <em>them.</em></p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>I don't like these bonfires. Not now. What good do they
do the gods? Is it true there were people burnt on them
once?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Oh, not just anyone. They burnt crippled children,
loafers, idiots. Useless people, or people who stole wheat.
And that was enough for the gods. Good or bad, it always
rained.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>What did the gods like about it? I mean, if it rained anyway.
And what about Athamas? Didn't the gods put out
the fire?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Look, the gods are our masters. They're like the landowners—they're
our masters too. You think they'd let one
of their kind burn? Not them. They help each other
out. But with us, it's different. Nobody helps us. Rain or
shine, what do the gods care? We're lighting the bonfires
tonight. Brings on the rain, they say. But do the landowners
care? Ever seen one of them come down to the fields?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>No, never.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Figure it out for yourself. Let's suppose a bonfire can
make it rain, and burning some useless loafer can save the
harvest. Well, how many owners' houses would you have to
burn, how many owners would you have to kill in the streets
to bring some justice back to the world and make us our
own masters again?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>What about the gods?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>What have the gods got to do with it?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>Didn't you say the gods and the owners are in it together?
They're masters.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Yes, they're the masters. Well, we'll give them their goat.
What else can we do? We'll burn the useless loafers, the
thieves who steal our wheat! We'll make a real bonfire.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>I wish it was morning, dad. These gods frighten me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>You're right, son. That's why we have to try and get the
gods on our side. At your age it would be a bad thing to
forget what the gods are like.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>I want to forget. The gods aren't just. Why do they have to
burn people alive?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>They wouldn't be gods if they didn't. They don't have
to work—how else do you expect them to spend their time?
In the days before there were landowners and there was
still some justice in the world, someone had to be killed
every once in a while to keep the gods happy. That's the
way they are. But nowadays they don't need that sort of
thing any more. There's so many of us being miserable that
the gods are happy just sitting there, watching us. That
satisfies <em>them.</em></p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>So <em>they're</em> the useless loafers!</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>You're right, son. Useless loafers is just what they are.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>What about the crippled children? What did they do when
they were burned? Did they scream?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>It's not the screaming that matters, son, it's who does the
screaming. Crippled people or criminals—they're both useless.
But when a man with children of his own sees a lot
of loafers getting fat at his expense, that's what hurts. That's
the injustice.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>It makes me shiver when I think of the bonfires they had
in the old days. Look down there. Bonfires burning everywhere.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>It wasn't the way you think, son. There wasn't a boy
burned on every bonfire. They did it then as we do now
with the goats. Figure it out for yourself. If one goat makes
it rain, there's rain enough for everybody. One man was
enough for a whole mountainside, a whole village.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Son: </span>I don't want to think about it. I won't. If that's the way
we treated each other, then the landowners have every
right to eat us alive. The gods are right to watch us suffer.
We're evil, we're all evil.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Father: </span>Wet down the branches, son, and sprinkle on the water.
You're too young to understand. Who are you to be talking
about what's right and wrong? No, stupid, over there,
towards the sea.</p>

<section id="dialogue-the-island">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Island</h2>
  <p class="intro">Everybody knows that when Odysseus was shipwrecked
on his way home from Troy, he spent nine years
on the island of Ogygia, where his only companion
was Calypso, an ancient goddess.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Odysseus, Calypso</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>Odysseus, our situations are much the same. You want
to live on an island, and so do I. You've seen and suffered
everything. Someday perhaps I'll tell you what I've suffered.
We're both tired of a burdensome duty. Why go on?
What do you care if this island isn't the one you were looking
for? Nothing ever happens here. A bit of land and a
horizon. Here you can live forever.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>An immortal life.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>Immortality means accepting the moment, no longer
recognizing a tomorrow. But if you like the word, use it.
Have you really reached that point?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>I used to think the man who wasn't afraid of death
was immortal.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>No, the immortal is the man who doesn't hope to live.
The man you almost are. You too have suffered a great deal.
But why this eagerness to return home? You're still restless.
Why do you wander off by yourself among the rocks and
talk to the sea?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>Would it upset you if I left tomorrow?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>You want to know too much, dear. Let's say that I'm
immortal. But if you don't renounce your memories and
your dreams, if you don't put your longing aside and accept
the horizon, you'll never escape that fate you know so well.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>Always the same advice. Accept the horizon. And
what will it get me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>Peace and quiet, Odysseus. Have you ever wondered
why is it that even we gods want sleep? Have you ever asked
yourself where the old gods go, the gods whom the world
has forgotten? Why it is that they sink deep into time, like
stones in the ground, though they live forever? Why I am,
who Calypso is?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>I asked you if you were happy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>It isn't that, Odysseus. The air, even the air of this
desert island, which quivers now with the dull roar of the
sea and the cries of the birds, is too empty. In this emptiness
there is nothing to be regretted, nothing at all. But
haven't you felt it too—on certain days, a silence, a pause,
like the trace of an old tension and presence, long since
vanished?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>So you talk to the rocks too?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>It's a silence, I tell you. Something remote, almost dead.
Something which has been and which will never be again,
from the old world of the gods when anything I did was
destiny. I had terrible names, Odysseus. The earth and sea
obeyed me. Then I grew tired. Time passed. I lost the will
to move. A few of us resisted the new gods; I let my names
sink deep into time. Everything changed and everything
remained the same; it wasn't worth the trouble to contest
destiny with the new gods. From that time on I knew my
horizon and why the Old Ones hadn't fought at our side.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>But weren't you immortal?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>Was and am, Odysseus. I have no hope of dying. And
no hope of living either. I accept the moment. You mortals
accept something like it, old age and regret. Why won't
you bow your head as I have, here on this island?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>I would, if I thought you were resigned. Once you
were mistress of all things. But now you need me, a mortal,
to help you endure,</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>The favor is mutual, Odysseus. The only real silences
are shared.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>It isn't enough that I'm here with you now?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>You aren't here with me, Odysseus. You don't accept
the horizon of this island. There is something you regret.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>What I regret is a living part of myself, just as your
silence is a part of you. What has changed for you since that
day when earth and sea obeyed you? You noticed that you
were alone, that you were tired and had forgotten your
names. Nothing has been taken from you. What you wanted
to be, you are.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>What I am is almost nothing, dear. Almost mortal,
almost a shade like you. It is all a long sleep which began
who knows when. And you arrived in this sleep like a dream.
I am afraid of the dawn, of waking up. If you leave me, I
will waken.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>That's no way for a goddess to be talking.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>I'm afraid of waking up, as you are afraid of death. Yes.
Once I was dead, now I know it. The only thing left of me
in this island was the voice of the wind and the sea. Oh,
I didn't suffer, I was asleep. But when you came, you
brought another island with you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>I've been looking too long for that island. You don't
know what it's like, catching sight of land and then shutting
your eyes in order to deceive yourself. I can't accept, can't
be silent.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>But according to you men, Odysseus, no good ever came
of recovering what you have lost. The past does not come
back. Nothing resists the passing of time. You are a man
who has looked at Ocean, the monsters, the Elysian Fields.
Will you still be able to recognize human houses, your own
home?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>It was you who said I carried an island with me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>Oh, but changed, lost, a silence. The echo of the sea
between two rocks, or a wisp of smoke. No one can share it
with you. The houses will look like an old man's face. Your
words will have a meaning which is not their own. You will
be lonelier than you were at sea.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>At least I'll know that's where my journey ends.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>It's no good, Odysseus. If you don't stop now, here and
now, you'll never stop again. What you do now, you will do
forever. You must break with your fate once and for all;
you must stop and let yourself sink deep into time . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>I'm not immortal.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>You will be, if you listen to me. What is eternal life if
it's not accepting the moment that comes and the moment
that goes? Drunkenness, pleasure, and death have no other
aim. What else has your restless wandering been until now?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>If I knew, I would have stopped. But you forget something.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Calypso: </span>What?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Odysseus: </span>The object of my quest is inside me. And so is yours.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-lake"><h2 class="dialogue-title">The Lake</h2>
<p class="intro">Hippolytus, the chaste huntsman of Troezen, met a
terrible death through the anger of Aphrodite. But
Diana restored him to life and carried him off to
Italy (Hesperia). Here in the Alban Hills she attached
him to her cult and gave him the name of Virbius.
Virbius had children by the nymph Aricia.
<br/>
For the ancients the West was—as in the Odyssey—the
land of the dead.</p>

<h3 class="interlocutors">Virbius, Diana</h3>

<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>I'll admit that I was glad to come here. This lake reminded
me of the old sea. And I was happy to live your
life, to be dead to the world, to serve you in the forest and
on the mountains. Here the wild animals, the peaks, the
peasants know nothing but you. It is a place where things
have no past, a place of the dead.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Hippolytus—</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>Hippolytus is dead. Virbius is the name you gave me.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Hippolytus, don't you mortals forget your lives even when
you're dead?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>Listen. So far as the world is concerned, I am dead; I am
your servant. When you snatched me away from Hades and
brought me back to the light, all I wanted was to move, to
breathe, and worship you. You set me here where earth and
heaven blaze with light, where everything is vigorous and
green, everything is new. Even the night here is fresh and
deep, fresher and deeper than it was at home. Here time
doesn't pass. There are no memories. And you are the only
power here.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>You're drenched with memories, Hippolytus. But suppose
I admit for a moment that this is a land of the dead.
What do the dead in Hades do but rehearse the past?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>Hippolytus is dead, I tell you. And this lake that looks
so much like the sky has never heard of Hippolytus. If I
weren't here, this country would be exactly as it is now.
It looks like some imagined place, a distant land glimpsed
through the clouds. When I was still a boy, I thought that
if I climbed to the other side of my native mountains, far
off in the distance where the sun sets—all I had to do was
keep on walking—I would come to the land of childhood,
where it was always morning, the land of the hunt and perpetual
play. A slave said to me, "Beware of what you desire,
my boy. The gods always grant it." It was this place I
wanted. I didn't know I wanted to die.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Merely another memory. Why are you unhappy?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>Oh, Wild One, I don't know. It seems only yesterday
that I opened my eyes here. I know that a great deal of
time has passed, and that these mountains, this lake, these
great trees are just the same, mute and unmoving. Who is
Virbius? Am I any different from a boy who wakes up every
morning and goes back to his games as though time had no
existence?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>You are Hippolytus, the boy who died to follow me. And
now you live beyond time. You have no need of memories.
Those who live with me live for the day, like the hare, like
the stag, like the wolf. They flee and are pursued forever.
This is no country of the dead, but the living twilight of an
enduring morning. You have no need of memories because
this is the only life you have ever known.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>If anything, this country is more vivid than my own. In
everything, in the sun too, there is a radiance of light as
though it came from within, a vigor that seems somehow
untouched by the days. What does this land of Hesperia
mean to you gods?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Nothing different from any other country anywhere. We
don't live on past or future. For us each day is like the first
day. What seems to you a vast silence is our sky.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>But I have lived in places you prefer to this. I've gone
hunting on Didymus; I've run along the beaches of Troezen,
places as poor and as wild as myself. But this inhuman silence,
this life beyond life—I've never breathed anything like this
before. What makes it so lonely here?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Lonely, child? A place where no man has ever set foot will
always be a land of the dead. From your seas and islands
other men will come, and they will think they are entering
Hades. And there are other countries even farther away . . .</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>Other lakes, other mornings like these. The water is
bluer than the plums among the leaves. I seem to be a
shadow among the shadows of the trees. The more I warm
myself in this sun and take nourishment from this earth, the
more I seem to dissolve into rustlings and drops of water, in
the sound of the lake, and the growls of the forest. Behind
the trunks of the trees, in the stones, in my own sweat, there
is a remoteness, a distance.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>These are the anxieties of your childhood.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>I'm not a child any more. I know you, and I have been
in Hades. My own country is as far away as those clouds up
there. Look, I slip between trees and objects as though I
were a cloud.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>You're happy, Hippolytus. If happiness is possible for
man, you are happy.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>The boy I was, the boy who died, is happy. You saved
him, and I thank you. But the man who was reborn, your
servant, the fugitive from Hades who guards your oaks and
your forests—he isn't happy because he doesn't even know
if he exists. Who answers his voice, who speaks to him?
Does his today add anything to his yesterday?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Is that all, Virbius? You want company?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>You know what I want.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Mortals always end by wanting that. Why? Is it something
in your blood?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>Are you asking me what blood is?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Sacrificial blood has the savor of god in it. How many
times have I seen you pull back the head of a kid or the
wolf, slash its throat, and plunge your hands into its blood!
I liked you for that. But that other blood, your own blood,
which swells your veins and blazes in your eyes—I'm less
familiar with that blood. I know that for you it is life and
destiny.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>I have already shed that blood. And feeling it run restless
and confused in me today is my proof of being alive.
The light of the lake, the green thrust of the trees—these
are not enough for me. They are things like clouds, everlasting
wanderers of morning and evening, guardians of the
horizons, shapes of Hades. Only other blood can still my
own. Blood running restlessly, and then stilled. Sated.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>In short, you want to sacrifice?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>That is what I want, Wild One. Before, when I was
Hippolytus, I sacrificed wild animals. They were enough. But
here in this land of the dead, even the animals dissolve between
my hands like clouds. It is my fault, I think. But I
need the closeness of warm blood, blood of my own kind.
I need to have a voice and a fate. O Wild One, grant me
this.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Diana: </span>Beware, Virbius-Hippolytus. You have been happy.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Virbius: </span>I don't care, lady. I've looked at my reflection in the lake
too often. It's life I want, not happiness.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-witches">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Witches</h2>
  <p class="intro">When Odysseus came to Circe's island, he had been
warned of the danger and immunized, magically,
against her spells. But the witch Circe—an ancient
Mediterranean goddess who had come down in the
world—had known for some time that an Odysseus
would enter her life. In this respect Homer's
account leaves something to be desired.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Circe, Leucothea</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Believe me, Leucò, I didn't understand all at once. Sometimes
you get the formula wrong, your mind suddenly goes
blank. And yet I'd touched him. The truth is I'd been expecting
him so long that I wasn't thinking about it anymore.
The moment I understood—he made a sudden movement
and reached for his sword—I almost smiled, I felt so
happy and at the same time disappointed. I even thought I
could avoid the whole affair and escape what had been fated.
After all, I said to myself, Odysseus is a man who wants to
go home. I thought about putting him in a boat immediately.
There he was, Leucò my dear, waving that sword of
his, ridiculous and clever as only a mortal can be—and I had
to smile and look at him square in the eye the way I do with
them, then look surprised and draw back. I felt as though I
were a girl again—when we were girls and they told us what
we'd do when we were grown up, and we all giggled. The
whole thing was like a dance. He took me by the wrists,
raised his voice, I blushed—I paled inwardly, Leucò—I
clasped his knees and went into my act. "Who are you, what
land gave birth to you . . ." Poor fellow, I thought to myself,
he doesn't know what's in store for him. He was a big man,
curly haired, handsome, Leucò. What a wonderful boar he
would have made—or maybe a wolf.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>But did you tell him all this, during the year he spent
with you?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Oh child, you don't speak of the things of destiny with a
mortal. They think they've said the last word when they call
it the Iron Chain, the Fatal Decree and so on. They call us
the Fatal Ladies, you know.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>They don't know how to smile.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Yes. Some of them can laugh in the face of destiny, but
they laugh afterwards. At the time they have to be serious
about it or they die. They don't know how to joke about
divine things, they don't have the sense of playing a role, as
we do. Their life is so short they can't bear to do things already
done or already known. If I talked to Odysseus in this
vein, he looked mystified and started talking about Penelope.
And he was a brave man.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>How tiresome.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Yes, but you see I really understood him. With Penelope
he didn't have to smile; with her everything, even their daily
meal, was serious and unrehearsed—they might have been
preparing themselves for death. You can't imagine the way
death fascinates them. They're destined to die, of course, it's
a repetition, something they know in advance. And yet they
deceive themselves into thinking that it changes something.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Then why didn't he want to become a boar?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Oh Leucò, he didn't even want to become a god, though
Calypso, that silly creature, kept nagging him about it. But
that was the way Odysseus was, neither boar nor god, just
man, a very intelligent man and clever in the face of destiny.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Tell me, my dear, did you enjoy yourself with him?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Something occurs to me, Leucò. Not one of us goddesses
has ever tried to become mortal, no one has ever wanted it.
Yet this might be the new thing, the thing that might break
the chain.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Would you like to?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Really, Leucò. Odysseus didn't understand why I smiled.
Often he didn't even understand that I was smiling. I
thought once I had explained to him why animals are more
like us immortals than a brave, intelligent man can be. An
animal eats, it mounts, it has no memory. He answered that
at home there was a dog waiting for him, a poor dog that
may have been dead already. And he told me its name. That
dog had a <em>name,</em> Leucò.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>They give us names too, you know.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>Odysseus gave me many names when he was in bed with
me. There was a new one every time. At first it was like the
noise an animal makes, a boar or a wolf, but bit by bit he
himself realized that he was spelling out the syllables of a
single word. He called me by the names of all the goddesses,
of our sisters, he called me by the names of the Mother of
all living things. It was as though he were struggling with
me, with fate. He wanted to name me, to hold me, make me
mortal. He wanted to break something. He brought intelligence
and courage to the job—he had both—but he could
never smile. He never understood the smile of the gods, the
way we, who know destiny, smile.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>No man understands us, or the animals either. I've
seen these men of yours—transformed into wolves or wild
boars they still howl like real men. It's tormenting. They're
so crude in spite of their intelligence. Have you played with
them much?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>I amuse myself with them, Leucò, as best I can. I wasn't
granted a god in my bed, and the only man was Odysseus.
All the others turn into animals at my touch; they go crazy
and come after me, like wild beasts. Their frenzy is no better
and no worse than the love of a god. But with them I
mustn't even smile. I feel them mount me and then run off
back to their lairs. I don't lower my eyes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>And Odysseus . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>I don't ask myself their names. Do you know who Odysseus
was?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Yes, Circe?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>One evening he described his arrival at Aeaea. His men
were frightened, they posted guards by the ships, and he told
me how all night long, stretched out their on the shore
under their cloaks, they listened to the roaring and the
snarling. Then when the sun rose, they saw a spiral of smoke
beyond the woods and they shouted for joy as they recognized
their country and their homes. He smiled as he told
me about this—in the way men smile—sitting beside me in
front of the fire. He said he wanted me to forget who I was and
where he was. That evening he called me Penelope.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Oh Circe, how silly!</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>I was silly too, Leucò, and I told him to cry.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Why, the idea.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>No, but he didn't cry. He knew that Circe loves wild animals,
who don't cry. He cried later on, the day I told him of
the long journey still to make and the descent into Avernus
and the blackness of Ocean. But they were the kind of tears
that clean your eyes and give you strength—I too can understand
them. But that evening, laughing strangely, he spoke
to me about his childhood and his destiny, and he asked
about me. He spoke playfully, of course.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>I don't understand.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>His mouth and his voice laughed, but his eyes were full of
memories. And then he told me to sing. And as I sang, I
went to the loom, and I put his home and his childhood
into that harsh voice of mine, I gentled it, I was his Penelope.
He took his head between his hands.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Who had the last laugh?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>No one, Leucò. That evening, I was mortal too. I had a
name: Penelope. That was the only time I looked my fate
in the face without laughing, the only time I lowered my
eyes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>And this man loved a dog?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>A dog, a woman, his son, and a boat to sail the sea. He
never looked on the endless cycle of days as destiny, he ran
towards his death knowing what it was, and enriched the
earth with words and actions.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>I don't have eyes like you, Circe, but here I feel it's
my turn to smile. You were naive. If you'd told him that the
wolves and boars mounted you like an animal, he'd have
turned into an animal himself.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>I did tell him. His mouth contracted, only a little though,
and after a while he said—"So long as they're not my men."</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>So he was jealous.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>No, not jealous. He was loyal to them. He understood
everything, that man, except the way we gods smile. The day
when he wept in my bed, it wasn't because he was afraid,
but because his last journey was imposed on him by fate, it
was something he knew in advance. "Why trouble to make
the journey, in that case?" he asked me as he buckled on his
sword and walked down to the sea. I brought him the black
lamb and while his men were weeping, he noticed a flight of
swallows over the roof. "So they're going too," he said.
"They don't know what they're doing. But you know, lady."</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Is that all he said?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>That was all.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Circe, why didn't you kill him?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>I'm a real fool. Sometimes I forget that we immortals
<em>know.</em> Then I'm as happy as though I were still a girl. As
though all these things happened to the great gods, to the
Olympians, and happened in this way, inexorably, but absurdly,
unforeseen. What I never manage to foresee is precisely
this, that I <em>have</em> foreseen, that I always know what I'm
going to do and say. And in this way what I do and say becomes
something always new and surprising. Like a game—like
that game of chess which Odysseus taught me, all rules
and regulations, but so new and exciting, with those lovely
ivory pieces! That game is like life, he used to say. According
to him, it was a way of overcoming time.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>You have too many memories of him, Circe. You
didn't turn him into a boar or a wolf. You turned him into
memory.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>That's the one immortal thing about a mortal, Leucò. The
memory he carries with him, the memory he leaves behind
him. That is what names and words are. When they remember
even men smile. A smile of resignation.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Circe, you're speaking words too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Circe: </span>I know my destiny, Leucò. Never fear.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-bull">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Bull</h2>
  <p class="intro">Everyone knows that Theseus, on his way home from
Crete, pretended to forget the black sails flying
from his mast in token of mourning. The result was
that his father, thinking him dead, threw himself
into the sea and left his kingdom to Theseus. This is
thoroughly Greek. And equally Greek is the distaste for
any mystical cult of monsters.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Lelegus, Theseus</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>That hill is home, sir.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>When you're away from home, any hill seen at twilight
looks like your own hills.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>Yes, when we saw the sun sinking behind Mt. Ida, we
drank a toast to our return.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>It's good to come home, Lelegus, and good to go away.
Let's drink again. Let's drink to the past. Things we've lost
and then recovered are good things.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>While we were in Crete, you never spoke of home. You
didn't think of all the things we'd left behind. You lived for
the day. And I saw you leave Crete in the same way you left
home, without once looking back. Are you thinking of the
past this evening?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>We're alive, Lelegus; there's wine on the table, we're in
home waters. A man thinks of a good many things on an
evening like this. Tomorrow, perhaps, these things—the
wine, the sea—won't give us the same peace.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>What are you afraid of? Why don't you give the order
to lower these black sails and break out the white? You
promised your father you would.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>Time enough for that later, Lelegus. Time enough tomorrow.
I like listening to these sails cracking in the wind.
The same sails we carried when we set our course for Crete
and danger, and not a man of you knew if he'd ever see
home again.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>But you knew, Theseus?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>More or less. My axe never misses.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>You don't sound very sure.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>It's not that. I'm thinking of the Cretans and how little
I knew about them. I'm thinking of the great mountain and
our role in the island. And those last days in the palace, with
its endless courtyards one after the other, and the soldiers
calling me the Bull-King—do you remember, Lelegus? You
become what you kill in Crete. Later I began to think I
understood them. Then they told us about the forests of Ida
where the caves of the gods are, where the gods were born
and where they died. Did you know, Lelegus? In the island
the gods are killed, killed like animals. And the man who
kills a god becomes a god himself. It was then that we tried
to climb Mt. Ida.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>A man feels brave when he's away from home.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>And they told us unbelievable things. Their women—you
remember those tall blonde women who spend the
morning basking in the sun on the palace terraces and at
night go up to the fields of Ida and lie with trees and beasts?
Sometimes they stay there for good.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>Only the women are brave there. You know that,
Theseus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>I know one thing—I prefer women who stay at their
looms.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>But there aren't any looms in Crete. They buy foreign
cloth. What do you expect them to do?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>Not sit around ripening in the sun, thinking about gods
all the time. Not look for gods in the trunks of trees and in
the sea. Not chase after bulls. At first I thought it was their
fathers' fault—those decadent merchants who dress like
women and spend their time watching boys vaulting over
bulls. And that isn't all. It's as though they were another
race, another breed. There was a time when there were only
goddesses on Ida. Only a single goddess. She was the sun,
she was the trees, she was the sea. And in her presence gods
and men were trampled underfoot. When a woman runs
away from a man to be with the sun and the beasts, it is not
a man's fault. The blood is rotten. This is chaos.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>Only you can say, sir. Is it Ariadne you're speaking of?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>Yes, her too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>You're the captain, sir, and it's not our place to criticize
you. But to us she seemed a gentle, docile girl.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>Too docile, Lelegus. Like grass, like sea water. You
looked at her and realized she wasn't even aware of you.
Like the meadows of Ida—you move forward, your hand on
your axe, and then suddenly the silence becomes suffocating
and you have to stop. There's a sound of breathing, like a
beast about to spring. Even the sun seems to be lying in
wait, even the air . . . There's no fighting with the great
Goddess. You can't fight the earth and its silences.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>Yes, I have known these things too. But Ariadne—she
let you out of the maze. She left home for you. She abandoned
her gods to follow you. If her blood was rotten, as you
say, she wouldn't have done that.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>But her gods didn't abandon her.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>Didn't you say they kill the gods on Ida?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>And the killer is the new god. Oh Lelegus, you can kill
gods and bulls in a cave, but the god you carry in your blood
cannot be killed. Ariadne too was blood and breed of the
island. I knew her as I knew the bull.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>You were too cruel, Theseus. What do you suppose she said,
poor girl, when she woke on Naxos?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>I know, I know. She must have howled, like a wild
thing. But in vain. She'll have called on her country and her
home and her gods. She still has the earth and the sun. We
Greeks are nothing to her now.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>She was beautiful, sir. She was made of earth and sun.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>Whereas we are only men. I'm certain that a god will
be sent to console her, some soft ambiguous god, a god of
sorrows, one of those who have already savored death, and
whom the Great Mother carries in her lap. What will he be,
I wonder? A tree, a horse, a ram? Or perhaps a lake or a
cloud? Anything can happen on that sea of hers.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>Sir, forgive me for speaking plainly. But I don't understand
you. Sometimes you speak like a boy playing a game.
And sometimes you sound old and cruel, as though the
island had left something of itself in you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>Perhaps, you may be right. A man becomes the thing he
kills. But we've come from a long way away, you forget that.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Lelegus: </span>This good Greek wine should cheer you up, sir.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Theseus: </span>We haven't reached home yet, Lelegus.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-in-the-family">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">In the Family</h2>
  <p class="intro">The tragic events which afflicted the house of
Atreus are well known. Here I need only recall certain
family relationships. Tantalus was the father of Pelops;
Pelops of Thyestes and Atreus; Atreus was the father
of Menelaus and Agamemnon, and Agamemnon of
Orestes, who killed his mother. It has long been my
conviction that the Arcadian sea goddess Artemis enjoyed
a special cult in this family. Think for instance of
the proposed sacrifice of Iphigenia by her father.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Castor, Polydeuces</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Remember, Poly, how we got her back after she eloped
with Theseus?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>That was a great night!</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>She was just a child then. I remember thinking as we
rode through the night how terrified she must be, galloping
through the forest on Theseus' horse, with us galloping after
her. We were naive.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>This time she's taken better precautions.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Yes, this time she's got the whole Trojan army to fight for
her. She's put the sea between us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Then we'll cross the sea.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>I've had enough. It's up to the Atreidae now. It's no
concern of ours.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>We'll cross the sea!</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Believe me, Poly, it's not worth it. Don't be naive. Let
the Atreidae take care of her—she's their worry now.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>But she's our sister!</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>We should have known she'd never stay put at Sparta.
She's not the sort of girl you can keep shut up in a palace.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>What else does she want, Castor?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>She doesn't want anything, that's just it. She's the same
child she always was! She's incapable of taking a home or a
husband seriously. But there's no use chasing after her. She'll
come back some day, you'll see.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Heaven knows what the Atreidae will do to avenge
this affront to their family. They're not people to swallow an
insult. Where their honor's at stake, they're as touchy as
the gods.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Leave the gods out of it. These are people who have
eaten each other in the past. Beginning with Tantalus, who
served up his own son at table . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>You really believe those stories?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>That's what you'd expect from <em>them.</em> People who live
in castles at Mycenae and Sparta, who wear golden masks;
rulers of the sea who squint out at it through arrow-slits—they're
capable of anything. Don't you sometimes wonder,
Polydeuces, why their women—and I include Helen—sooner
or later turn wild and violent, why they murder and drive
others to murder? There's not one man of the house of
Pelops, not one, whose wife has closed his eyes at death. If
that's what being touchy about their honor means . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>But our little sister Clytemnestra—she's not like
those women.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Don't count your chickens, Poly.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>If you knew all this, why did you let the girls marry
into that family?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>I didn't let them. These things happen. Everyone gets
the wife he deserves.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>What do you mean by that? That their women are
as bad as they are? Are you criticizing our sister?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Come off it, Poly. Nobody's listening. Don't you understand
that the men of this family always marry the same
woman? We're Helen's brothers, maybe we don't really
know her. It took Theseus to give us an idea. Then there
was Menelaus. Now it's Paris, a foreigner. I ask you, is all
this just coincidence? Does she always have to fall for men
like that? No, it's obvious that they were made for each
other.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>You're crazy!</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Nothing crazy about it! If the Tantalids lost their heads—literally,
in some cases—that's their business. A race of sea
kings who live cooped up in those mountain castles of
theirs . . . There may have been a time when they saw the
world—Tantalus certainly did. But after him they shut
themselves up with their women and their piles of gold—suspicious
and discontented, incapable of energy or action.
The sea fed them, fed them well: fat, gross, gluttonous men.
A family of feasters! That's why they wanted strong, half
savage women to shut up in their castles with them. They've
always found what they wanted.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>But I don't see what Helen has to do with all this. Or
why you say she was made for men like Theseus and Paris.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>For them or others, Poly, the names don't matter. It's the
house of Atreus we're talking about. And if the women of
that house, from Hippodameia on, were as like one another
as a herd of wild mares, it wasn't their fault. You could almost
say the story of that family is the same man looking
for the same woman: and finding her, over and over. Every
one of their women, from Hippodameia down to Helen and
Clytemnestra, has had to fight and defend herself. This is
obviously what the Tantalids like in their women. They
don't know it, but it's what they want. They're schemers,
men of blood. Fat men, bloated with power. They need a
woman with a whip.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Who cares what Hippodameia did? All right, so she
whipped her horses in that chariot race. I know the story too.
What's that got to do with our sister? Helen has the hand
of a child, a hand that's never held a whip. How can you
compare them?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>We don't know much about women, do we, Poly? We
all grew up together, and to us she's still a little girl playing
ball. But a woman doesn't have to whip horses to feel her
blood run wild. It's enough to please the fancy of a man like
Menelaus.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Anyway, what was so bad about Hippodameia?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>She treated men as though they were horses. That's what.
She got her charioteer to murder her father. Then she had
Pelops murder the charioteer. She gave birth to Atreus and
Thyestes, both murderers. She made blood flow in torrents.
<em>She</em> didn't run away, not her.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>But didn't you say that all this was Pelops' fault?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>I said that Pelops and all the men of his family preferred
women like that. That they deserved the women they got.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>But Helen doesn't murder. She doesn't make men
murder.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Are you sure, Poly? Remember when we got her back
from Theseus—three horses galloping through the forest? If
we weren't all killed then, it was because we were boys and
to us it was almost a game. And wasn't it you who asked just
now how much blood the Atreidae will shed?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>But she doesn't drive anyone to murder.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>Do you think Hippodameia drove the charioteer? She
simply smiled and said her father wanted her. She didn't
even say she disliked the idea . . . A look can kill. Then
when Myrtilus saw he'd been tricked by Pelops and he
wanted to shout out the truth, all Hippodameia had to say
to her husband was: "Keep your eyes on that man—he
knows about Oenomaus." The Tantalids have a liking for
that kind of talk.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Do all their women kill, then?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>No, not all. Some bow their heads and resign themselves.
But sooner or later the castle unleashes the beast in them.
The Tantalids kill and are killed. They have to whip or be
whipped.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Helen just ran away.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>You think so, Poly? Remember Atreus' wife, Aerope?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>She was drowned.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>But not before she drove her lover to steal the golden
ram. There's a woman who was driven wild by the castle.
A woman who could have spent her days in idle lechery,
growing fat beside her lover. But her lover was Thyestes, her
husband was Atreus. They had chosen her and they left her
no way out. They unleashed the beast in her too, like the
other women. The Tantalids have a craving for violence.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Our sister too? You mean they'll put her to death for
adultery? You mean she's a whore?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>If only she were, Poly, if only she were. But being a whore
isn't a matter of choice. Not when you're married to one of
the Atreidae. Don't you see that for them sexual pleasure
means taking a woman by force, beating her till she bleeds?
They wouldn't know what to do with a tame, submissive
woman. They need a woman with cold, killer's eyes, eyes
without shame. Eyes like arrow-slits. Like Hippodameia's.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>I've seen that look in Helen's eyes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>They need the cruelty of a virgin. The virgin who moves
on the mountains. <em>She,</em> she is the woman they marry. For
her they serve up their sons, for her they murder their daughters . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Polydeuces: </span>Those days are gone forever.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Castor: </span>They're just beginning, Polydeuces.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-argonauts">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Argonauts</h2>
  <p class="intro">The temple on the Acrocorinth, with its attendant
hierodules, is mentioned by no less an author than
Pindar. That the young monster-slayers should all
(Theseus the Athenian included) have had trouble
with women is something we might have imagined
for ourselves, even if the tradition did not unanimously
suggest it. With one of the worst of these women,
Medea—witch, jealous wife, infanticide—Euripides
deals at generous length in a famous play.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Jason, Melita</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Go ahead, pull the curtains wide, Melita. I can feel the
breeze swelling it. On a morning like this, even Jason wants
to see the sky. Tell me what the sea is like, tell me what's
been happening in the harbor.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>Oh king Jason, it's lovely from up here. The docks are
crammed with people and there's a big ship going out between
the boats. It's so clear you can see it reflected upside
down in the water. Oh, look at the flags and the prows hung
with flowers—if only you could see them! And what a lot of
people! They've even climbed up the statues on the docks.
Now the sun's in my eyes.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>The other girls are probably there to say goodbye. Can
you see the, Melita?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>I don't know, there are so many people. Look, the sailors
are waving to us. Oh, how tiny they look, up there on the
rigging.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Wave to them, Melita. It must be the Cyprus ship. They'll
pass by your islands, and when they talk about Corinth and
its famous temple, they'll talk about you too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>What would they say about me, sir? Who in the islands
remembers me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Young people always have someone who remembers them.
It's good to remember the young. The gods are young, aren't
they? That's why we all remember them and envy them.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>We serve them, king Jason. I serve the goddess too in my
own way.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>There'll be someone, Melita, a guest or a sailor who climbs
up to the temple to sleep with you and not with any of the
others. Someone who leaves part of his offering to you alone.
I'm old, Melita, and I can't climb up there now. But there
was a time once, in Iolchos—you weren't even born then—when
I would have climbed more than a mountain to be
with you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>You give the orders, sir. At the temple we do what you
say. Oh look, the ship is spreading sail! It's all white. Come
and look, king Jason.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>No, you stay by the window, Melita, and I'll look at you
while you look at the ship. I can almost see the pair of you
catching the wind together. The morning air would make
me shiver. I'm an old man. I'd see too many things if I
looked down there.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>The ship's keeling in the sun. How she flies! She's skimming
the water like a dove.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>And she's only making for Cyprus. Nowadays ships put out
from Corinth and the islands, furrowing the sea everywhere.
But there was a time when this sea was like a desert. You
weren't born then, Melita. How long ago it all seems.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>You really mean, sir, that no one dared cross the sea?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>There's a virginity in things, Melita, more frightening than
danger. Think of the terror of the mountain peaks, how
sound re-echoes there.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>The mountains aren't for me. But I can't believe the sea
ever frightened any one.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>As a matter of fact, it didn't. It was on a morning like that
we put out from Iolchos. We were all young and the gods
were with us. It was wonderful just sailing on, without a
thought of tomorrow. Then strange, incredible things began
to happen . . . It was a younger world, Melita, with days
like clear mornings, nights of dense blackness, a world
where anything could happen. Sometimes the strange
things were men, sometimes they were monsters, or springs,
or rocks. Some of us disappeared, some died. Every landfall
was a loss. Every day the sea was more beautiful, more virginal.
The days went by in waiting for something . . . Then
the rains came, fogs, black foam.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>Yes, you have told me of these things.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>The danger wasn't the sea. We realized, from one landfall
to the next, that we had grown during our journey. We
were stronger, more detached. We were like gods, Melita,
but it was this that led us toward fatal risks. So we made
land at Phasis, there on the fields of golden crocus. Oh I was
young then, and I looked squarely at my fate.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>When we talk of you and your companions, in the temple,
we lower our voices.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Yes, and sometimes you laugh, Melita, I know. Corinth is
a gay place and people like to laugh. When will that
old fellow stop running on about his gods, they say. Anyway,
those gods are dead, aren't they, like the rest of the gods?—Life
is what Corinth wants.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>Up at the temple, we talk about the witch, king Jason.
Some people still remember her. Tell me about her, sir.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Everyone knows a witch, except here at Corinth where the
temple teaches people to laugh. We Argonauts, old or
young, we all knew a witch.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>But what about <em>your</em> witch, sir?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>We violated the sea, we destroyed monsters, we walked
through the fields of saffron. A golden cloud glittered in the
wood. And yet everyone of us died through the arts of a
witch, everyone of us died by the spells of the passion of
a witch. One of our crew had his head torn off and thrown
into a river. One has grown old. He's talking to you now . . .
He saw his children sacrificed by their mother in her madness.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>They say she isn't dead, sir, they say her spells have conquered
death.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>It's her destiny—I don't envy her. She breathed death, she
spattered it around her. Perhaps she's gone home.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>But how could she have laid hands on her own children?
She must have cried terribly . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>I never saw her cry, Medea couldn't cry. And the only time
she ever smiled was when she said she would go away with
me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>But she did go away with you, king Jason, she left her
country and her home, she accepted her fate. You were cruel
like all young men. Even you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>I was young, Melita. Nobody laughed at me in those days.
But I didn't know then that your way, the way of the temple,
is wiser, and that what I asked of the goddess was impossible.
But for us everything seemed possible. We had
destroyed the dragon, captured the golden cloud. Men do
evil trying to be great, trying to be gods.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>But why is your victim always a woman?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Little Melita, you're one of the temple girls. Surely you all
know that when a man climbs up there it's because he
wants to become a god, at least for a day, for an hour. Because
he wants to sleep with you as though you were the
goddess. He always pretends he's sleeping with her, then he
realizes it's only mortal flesh he was dealing with, poor
human creatures like you and your friends up there, like all
women. Then he flies into a rage and tries to be a god somewhere
else.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>Though some men seem quite happy with us, sir.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Oh yes, men grown old before their time, men who pay
your visits . . . But not before they've tried everything else.
Not someone who's seen other days. Have you heard of the
son of Aegeus who went down to Hades to bring back
Persophone—the son of that king of Athens who threw himself
into the sea?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>The men from Phaleron speak of him. He was a sailor
like you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Little Melita, he was almost a god. He found his woman
overseas, a woman who helped him in a fatal task, as the
witch helped me. He abandoned her, on an island, early one
morning. Then there were new conquests, new horizons, and
lunar Antiope, that restless Amazon, was his. And then
Phaedra, the light of the day, and she too killed herself. And
Helen, the daughter of Leda. Till at last he tried to snatch
Persephone from the jaws of Hades. There was only one
woman he never wanted—the one who fled from Corinth,
who murdered her children, the witch . . . You know about
her.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>But you still remember her, sir. You're kinder than king
Theseus. And since then you haven't made any woman cry.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Here at Corinth I've learned not to be a god. And I
know you, Melita.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>Oh king Jason, what am I?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>A girl of the islands who comes down from her temple
when the old man calls her. And you are the goddess too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>I am her slave.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>She has a great sanctuary in an island in the west which
bears your name.* Did you know?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>It's an ordinary name, sir, they gave it to me as a joke.
Sometimes I think of those lovely names the witches have
and the women who wept for great men like you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>Megara, Iole, Auge, Hippolyta, Omphale, Deianeira . . .
Do you know what man it was who wept for them?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Melita: </span>Oh, but he was a god. And now he lives with the gods.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Jason: </span>So they say. Poor Heracles, he was one of us too. I don't
envy him.</p>

  <p class="intro">After the adventure in the labyrinth, Ariadne was
abandoned by Theseus on the island of Naxos. It was
there that Dionysus, on his return from India, made
harvest of her beauty and set her among the
constellations of heaven.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Leucothea, Ariadne</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>How much longer are you going to cry, Ariadne?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Oh. Where did <em>you</em> come from?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>From the sea, like you. Well, have you stopped sobbing?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>I can't very well cry with you here, can I?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>I thought you mortal women only cried when you
had an audience.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>For a nymph, you've got a sharp tongue.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>So he's gone away too, has he? Why do you think
he deserted you?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Look, who <em>are</em> you?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>A girl who did what you didn't do. I tried to drown
myself. Ino was my name then. A goddess rescued me, and
now I'm the nymph of the island.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Well, what do you want with me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>If that's your tone, you already know the answer.
I've come to tell you that your handsome boyfriend with the
fine promises and the violet curls, is gone for good. He's
jilted you. The black sail disappearing from sight will be
your last memory of him. So sob and carry on as much as
you like. It's all over.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>You tried to kill yourself. Were you jilted too?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>We're not talking about me, dear. You're a silly,
stubborn girl. You don't deserve what I'm going to tell you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Listen, sea-nymph, what you want with me I don't
know. You've told me very little—or a great deal too much.
If I want to kill myself, I'll manage it on my own, thank
you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Believe me, silly. Your tears are trivial.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Is that what you came to tell me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Why do you think he deserted you?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Oh nymph, please don't . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Go on, cry. It makes things easier. Talking won't help
you. Only crying will rid you of your silly pride, and expose
your grief for the petty thing it is. But until your heart
breaks, until you howl like a bitch and want to snuff yourself
in the sea like a blazing brand, you won't know what
grief is.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>My heart . . . is broken . . . already.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Go on. Cry. Don't say a word . . . You don't know
anything. Someone else is waiting for you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>What's your name now, nymph?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Leucothea. Listen, Ariadne. The black sail has gone
for good. That chapter's finished.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>And my life is finished with it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Someone else awaits you, silly girl. Tell me, what god
did you worship in your country?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>What god can send his ship back to me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>I asked you what god you worshipped.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>In my country there's a mountain which inspired even
the sailors with terror. Great gods are born on that mountain,
and they are the gods we worship. I've already prayed
to them all, but none of them has heard me. What can I do?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>What do you expect from the gods?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>I don't expect anything any more.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Then listen. Someone is coming.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>What do you mean?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>I tell you, someone is coming.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>But you're only a nymph.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Perhaps. But even a nymph can announce a great god.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>A god, Leucothea? Which god?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Are you thinking of the god? Or your boyfriend?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>I don't know. What do you mean? I kneel before the gods.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Then you understand. He is a new god. The youngest
of all the gods. He has seen you, and he likes you. His name
is Dionysus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>I've never heard of him.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>He was born at Thebes, and he courses the world.
He is a god of joy. All mankind follows him and acclaims
him.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Is he strong?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>He kills with laughter. Bulls and tigers walk beside
him. His life is a festival, and he likes you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>But when did he see me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Who knows? Have you ever been in a vineyard on a
hillside by the sea, in that drowsy hour when the earth gives
off its own particular fragrance? A lingering smell of grapevines,
halfway between fig and pine? At the hour when the
grapes ripen, and the air is heavy with must? Have you ever
seen a pomegranate, blooming and fruiting? This is where
Dionysus grows and is, and in the cool of the ivy, among
the pines and over the threshing-floors.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Isn't there any place on earth so lonely that the gods
can't see us there?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>My dear, the gods are the place itself, the loneliness,
the passing of time. Dionysus will come, and you'll think
you've been whirled away by a great wind, like those dust
devils that swirl over the threshing-floors and the vineyards.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>When will he come?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>I'm here to announce his coming, dear. This is why
the boat sailed away.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Who told you all this?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>My home is Thebes, Ariadne. I'm his mother's sister.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>In my country people say that the gods were born on
Mt. Ida. No mortal has ever climbed beyond the timberline.
Even the shadow thrown by the mountain frightens us.
How can I accept what you say?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>You have run risks before, little one. Wasn't your friend
with the violet curls like a god to you?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>He was a god—whose life I saved. What good did it
do me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>A great deal. You've been afraid, you've suffered.
You've thought of dying. You've learned what waking is.
Now you're alone, and you're expecting a god.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>What's he like? Is he cruel?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>All gods are cruel. Divinity is cruel by nature. It
shatters the frail being who resists. To waken, to waken
well, you must yield to sleep. No god can know remorse.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>This Theban god of yours . . . You said he kills with laughter?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>Those who resist him. Those who resist him are torn
to pieces. But he is no more pitiless than other gods. For
him laughing is like breathing.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>Then he's no different from any mortal.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>This too is an awakening, child. It will be like loving
a place, a stream of water, an hour of the day. No man can
give you this. The gods last as long as the things that make
them gods. So long as the goats frisk through the pines and
the vineyards, he will please you and you will please him.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Ariadne: </span>I'll die like any goat.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Leucothea: </span>The stars shine over the vineyards at night. The god
who waits for you is a god of the night. Don't be afraid.</p></section>

  <p class="intro">Kratos and Bia—Power and Strength—lived, Hesiod
tells us, "not far from Zeus." This was their reward

many adventures.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Kratos, Bia</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>He's gone off to visit mankind. He has taken to road
through the valleys, he lingers among the vineyards or by
the seashore. Sometimes he goes up to the gates of a town.
No one would take him for the Lord, the Father of gods
and men. I can't understand what he's looking for. After all
that trouble we had putting the world in his hands—giving
him the fields and the mountain peaks and the clouds . . .
He could sit up there at his ease. And what does he do? He
goes off to visit mankind.</p>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>They're part of the world too, you know.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>Things aren't what they used to be, somehow. "He'll
come like the storm," Mother said, "and the seasons will
change." This son of the Mountain who rules with his nod
isn't like the old masters, Night and Earth and Father
Ouranos and Chaos. The world seems to be divided. Every
event had its goal, and everything that lived was one. But
now there's a law and a mind. Zeus has made himself immortal
and us along with him. Even men pay attention to
us: they know they have to die, and that sets them to thinking
about us. Up to that point I can understand them—that
was why we fought the Titans. But what I don't like
is that he, the Lord, who from his seat on the mountains
promised us these gifts should leave the peaks and go off
to amuse himself among mankind. I don't like it, I tell you.
What do you think, sister?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>He wouldn't be the Lord if he were bound by the laws he
made. But do you think he really breaks his own laws?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>I don't understand him and that's a fact. When we made
our assault on the mountains, he smiled—as though he'd
won already. He fought with nods, with a few brief words.
He never showed he was angry with the Titans for their
revolt. They were defeated and he simply smiled, smiled.
That was how he crushed the Titans, and mankind. I admired
him then; he was merciless. And I remember another
occasion when he smiled in the same way: when he decided
to give mankind the woman, Pandora, to punish them for
the theft of fire. I simply don't understand after this how
he can spend his time in vineyards and towns.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>Maybe the woman, Pandora, is not mere misfortune. Perhaps
he sees some good in her, perhaps he takes pleasure in
her. After all, he did give her to men.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>But do you realize what men are? Wretched little creatures
who are bound to die. More wretched than worms or
last year's leaves: they're dead and they don't even know
they die. But men do know and they talk about it, they
never stop invoking us, trying to snatch a favor or a glance
from us. They light fires to us—the fires they stole away in
the fennel stalk. And with their women and their offerings
and their songs and their fine words they have persuaded
some of us immortals to go down among them and be kind
to them and have children by them. Do you see what they're
after, their wretched, brazen deceit? Do you understand
now why I'm angry?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>Mother was right, the world has changed. That's what you're
saying. This isn't the first time the lord of the Mountain
has gone down among men. Have you forgotten how long
ago he lived in exile on an island in the sea where he died
and was buried. That used to happen to the gods in those
days.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>Yes, it's an old story.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>But that didn't mean his power was lost. No, it was
the lords of Chaos who were lost, they who once ruled over
a world without law. In the beginning, men and animals
and even stones were gods. Everything happened without
a name and without a law. The change came later. It took
a great deal to turn the son of Kronos into the good Judge,
into restless, immortal mind. He had first to take flight and
suffer the unjust punishment of living in exile among men
when he was still a baby, suckled by a goat. He had to grow
up on the mountain and the forests. Men had first to find
words and the laws to live by, grief and death and the
sense of loss. Only then did the son of Kronos change his
nature. And you, do you think you really helped him to
crush the Titans? Why, he fought as though he had won
already. You said so yourself. The reborn child became the
master living among men.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>So be it. Law was worth fighting for. But why does he
have to go down there again now that he's master of us all?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>Brother, dear, will you try to understand that even though
the world is no longer divine, for this very reason the gods
who come down from the Mountain find it always new and
always rewarding. To hear the speech of men—what a marvelous
experience that can be! They know they suffer, they
struggle, they possess the earth. All this is revealed in their
words. No wonder the young gods, who have come after the
lords of Chaos, are all down on earth among men. And if
some of the gods still keep their love for the high places,
for the caves and the savage skies, this is because men have
penetrated even there. There voices love to violate our
silence.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>If the son of Kronos would only be content with visiting
men. With listening to them and punishing them, according
to the law. But how can he bring himself to enjoy them and
be enjoyed by them? How can he steal away their women
and their sons?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>If you had known them, you'd understand. Men are poor
worms, but with them everything is unforeseen, everything
is a discovery. You can understand an animal and even a
god, but no one, not even we immortals, knows what is
going on in the hearts of men. Some of them even dare to
make a stand against destiny. Only if you live with them and
for them can you enjoy the savor of the world.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>Or the savor of the women? The daughters of Pandora,
animals—</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>Women or animals, it's all the same. Or brother, you don't
understand. They're the choicest fruit of mortal life.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Kratos: </span>Does Zeus approach them as animal or as god?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Bia: </span>As man, silly. That's the point.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-mystery">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Mystery</h2>
  <p class="intro">Everyone likes hearing that the Eleusinian mysteries
presented the initiate with a divine image of
immortality in the person of Dionysus and Demeter
(also Core and Pluto). What one likes less is the
reminder that Demeter is the ear of wheat—bread—and
Dionysus the grape—wine. "Take and eat this . . ."</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Dionysus, Demeter</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>These mortals are really amusing. We know things,
and they do them. I wonder what our lives would be like
without them. What would we Olympians be? They call on
us with their feeble voices, and they give us names.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>I existed before there were men, and I can tell you it
was lonely. The earth was forest, snakes, turtles. We were
the earth, the air, the water. What could one do? It was
in those days that we began the custom of being immortal.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>With men that never happens.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>True. Everything they touch becomes time. Becomes
action. Waiting and hope. Even their dying is something.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>They have a way of giving names to themselves and
things and us which enriches life. Like the vineyards that
they've taught themselves to grow on these hillsides. When
I brought the first vine to Eleusis, I never dreamed they
would make such a delicious place of these wild, rocky
slopes. And the same is true of their crops and their gardens.
Wherever they lavish their sweat and their speech, a
rhythm, a sense, a repose is born.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>And that talent they have for making stories about us!
I sometimes wonder if I really am Gaia, Rhea, Cybele, the
Great Mother, as they say I am. They have the knack of
giving us names that reveal us to ourselves, Iacchus. They
lift us from the grey eternity of fate and quicken us with
colors, painting us in the days and places where we are.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>For us you will always be Deo.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Who could have guessed that their wretched lives
could hold such riches? For them I am a fierce mountain,
bristling with forest; I am cloud and cave, goddess of harvests
and towers and cities; Lady of the Lions, goddess of
cradle and tomb, and mother of Core. Everything I am I
owe it to them.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>They're always talking about me, too.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Then shouldn't we help them more, Dionysus? Make
amends to them somehow? Stand at their side in the brief
instant of their lives?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>You gave them grain, Deo. I gave them the vine. Let
them be. What more do they need?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>I don't know why it is, but our gifts are always ambiguous.
Double-bladed axes. My son Triptolemus almost had
his throat cut when he brought that Scythian stranger his
gift of grain. Even your gifts cause the shedding of innocent
blood, Dionysus. Or so I hear.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>But they wouldn't be men if they weren't miserable.
Death is what they're born for. It's death that drives them
to their efforts, to memory and foresight. And don't go
supposing, Deo, that their blood is any better than the wheat
or wine with which we feed it. Blood is vile, foul, wretched.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>You're young Iacchus, and you don't know that they
discovered us in blood. You course restlessly through the
world, and for you death is like wine: exalting, an ecstasy.
But you forget that mortals have suffered every story they
tell of us. How many mortal mothers have lost their Core
and never seen her again? Even today the richest offering
they can make is blood.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>Is it an offering, Deo? You know better than I that
there was a time when they thought that in killing their
victim they were killing us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Can you blame them? This is why I said they discovered
us in blood. If for them death is the end and the
beginning, then they have to kill us in order to see us
reborn. They are very unhappy, Iacchus.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>You think so? They seem stupid to me. But maybe
not. They are so mortal that by killing themselves they give
a meaning to life. They have to live and die their own
stories. Take what happened to Icarius . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Poor Erigone.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>Yes, but Icarius was killed because he wanted to be
killed. Maybe he thought his blood was wine. He gathered
the grapes, pressed them, and drew off the wine. He worked
like a madman. It was the first time a froth of must was
ever seen on a threshing-floor. The bushes, the walls, the
shovels were spattered with it. Even Erigone plunged her
hands in it. Then what did the stupid old fool do but go
down to the fields and ask the herdsmen to drink with him?
And when they were drunk on it, poisoned, raging like wild
animals, they tore him to pieces like a goat among the scrub
and then buried him in order to grow more wine. He knew
what would happen, it was what he wanted. Was Erigone
surprised? No, she'd tasted that wine, she knew it would
happen too. So how else could she round off this story
except by hanging herself in the sun like a bunch of grapes?
There's nothing sad about it. Mortals tell their stories with
blood.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>And do you think this sort of thing is worthy of us?
You were wondering what we would be like without them.
You know that someday they may grow tired of us gods. You
understand? Your own interests as a god are bound up with
blood—that wretched blood, as you call it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>But what should we give them? Whatever it is, they'll
turn it into blood. Always blood.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>There's only one thing to do, and you know what it is.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>What?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Give a meaning to their dying.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>But how?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>By teaching them the life of the blessèd.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>But that's tempting fate, Deo. They're mortals.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Listen. The day will come when they'll think of it
themselves. And they'll do it without us, with a story.
They'll tell stories of men who have conquered death.
They've already put one of their number in heaven. Every
six months one of them goes down to Hades. One of them
has fought with Death and won back a living creature . . .
Mark my words, Iacchus. They'll do it on their own. And
then we'll go back to being what we were: air, water, and
earth.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>It won't help them live longer.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Of course not, silly boy. But their dying will have a
meaning. They too will die in order to be reborn, and they
won't need us anymore.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>What do you suggest, Deo?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Teach them that they can become like us, beyond grief
and death. But we'll tell them ourselves. Teach them that
just as the wheat and the vine go down beneath the earth
in order to be born again, so death is a new life for them
too. Give them this holy story. Lead them upward by means
of this story. Teach them a fate which is woven with our
own.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>They'll die anyway.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>They'll die, and they will conquer death. They will
see something beyond blood, they will see the two of us.
They'll no longer be afraid of death, and they won't have to
placate it by shedding other blood.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>We can do it, Deo, we can. We can give them the
story of eternal life. I almost envy them. They won't know
destiny and they will be immortal. But don't expect the
bloodshed to stop.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>Their only thought will be eternity. But there's one
danger. They may neglect these fertile fields.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>For a while. But once the grain and the vineyard take
on the meaning of eternal life, do you know what men will
see in bread and wine? Flesh and blood, as now, as always.
Flesh and blood will be spilled, not to placate death but to
reach the eternal which awaits them.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Demeter: </span>It's as though you could read the future. How do you
know?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Dionysus: </span>From looking at the past, Deo. Believe me. But I agree
with you. It will always be a story.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-flood">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Flood</h2>
  <p class="intro">The Greek flood too was a punishment for a mankind
which had lost respect for its gods. It is well known
that the earth was later repopulated by the throwing
of certain stones . . .</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Satyr, Hamadryad</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>I wonder what mortals think of this rain.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>What do they know about it? They take it. Maybe some of
them hope it will mean a bigger harvest.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>The rivers are already in flood, sweeping away the
trees. Everywhere it rains, it rains on water now.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>They're huddled together in caves and huts on the mountains.
They listen to the rain. They think of the people down
in the valleys who are fighting the flood, and they hope.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>They'll go on hoping for the rest of the night. But
tomorrow morning, in that terrible dawn, when they see
nothing but a sheet of water stretching to the horizon, and
the mountains shrunk to nothing, they won't go back to the
caves. They'll look. They'll cover their heads against the
rain, and they'll look.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>You're confusing them with wild animals. No mortal can
know that he's dying and look directly at death. Men have
to run, think, talk. Talk to the survivors.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>This time there won't be any survivors. What will
they do then? That's what I want to see.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>When they realize they're all doomed, every man on
earth, they'll celebrate. You'll see. Perhaps they'll come
looking for us.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>Us? What do we have to do with them?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>A great deal. For them we are the festival they celebrate.
We are life. They'll come to us in search of life. They'll
look for life to the very end.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>I don't see what life we can give them. We can't
even die. All we can do is look. Look and know. But according
to you they can't look at death and they don't know
how to resign themselves. So what can they want with us?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>Many things, sweet goat. For them we are like wild animals.
Animals are born and die like the leaves. They glimpse
us disappearing between the branches and they begin to
think of us as being somehow divine—that when we run to
hide we are the life that endures in the forest—a life like
their own, but everlasting, a richer life. They'll come looking
for us. Mark my words. We'll be their last hope.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>Hope? In a rain like this? And what will they do?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>Don't you know what it means to hope? They'll believe
that a forest where we live can't possibly be flooded. They'll
tell themselves that it's inconceivable that mankind should
utterly, totally, disappear; otherwise what meaning would
there be in being born and knowing us? They'll realize that
the great gods, the gods of Olympus, desire their death. But
we, like them, like the little animals, are life, earth, the
reality that matters. The seasons of their life are festivals,
and we are their festivals, the life they celebrate.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>That's convenient. They have the hope, and we
have the destiny. But it's stupid.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>Not so stupid as you think. They'll salvage something.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>Yes, but who provoked the great gods' anger in the
first place? Who was it who made such a mess of things that
even the sun hid his face? They did, if you ask me. So it
serves them right.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>Come, my dear, do you really believe that nonsense? Don't
you think, if they had really violated life, that life itself
could have punished them without any need for Olympus
to send down this flood? Believe me, if anybody has violated
anything, it isn't them.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>Yes, but they're doing the dying. How will they
feel tomorrow when they know what has happened?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>Listen to the torrent, little one. Tomorrow we'll be under
water too. You like to look; well, you'll see some ugly sights.
It's a good thing we can't die.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>Sometimes I'm not so sure. I wonder what it would
be like to die. Dying's the only thing we really don't have.
We know everything, and yet this one simple thing we don't
know. I'd like to try it—and then wake up, of course.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>Listen to the girl. But dying is precisely this—no longer
knowing that you're dead. And this is what this flood means:
dying in such numbers that there won't be anyone left to
know it. That's why they'll come to look for us. And they'll
ask us to save them and they'll want to become like us, like
plants and stones—insensible things that are nothing but
destiny. In them they will save themselves. When the waters
retreat, they'll come forth as stones and trees, just as
they did before. And this is all that mortals want, just as
before.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>Strange people. They treat destiny and the future as
though it were a past.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>That's the meaning of hope. Giving destiny a name to
remember it by.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>And you think they'll really be turned into stones
and trees?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>They have the knack of making myths, these mortals. Their
future lives will be modeled upon the imaginative shape they
give to their terror of tonight and tomorrow. They will be
wild animals and rocks and plants. They will be gods. They
will even dare to kill the gods in order to make them live
again. They will give themselves a past in order to escape
death. They are only and always these two things: hope or
destiny.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>If that's so, I can't pity them. It must be wonderful
to live in a world of utter make-believe.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>Yes, it's wonderful. But you mustn't suppose that they're
aware of improvising, of their make-believe. Their most
miraculous escapes have been made quite by accident, when
they were already caught in the crushing grip of destiny.
They don't have time to savor their own make-believe. All
they can do is pay for it in person. That much they can do.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>Well, I hope this flood at least serves to teach them
the meaning of festival and play. After all, there's a make-believe
which destiny imposes upon us immortals and which
we are aware of—why can't they learn to live their make-believe
as though each moment of their wretched little lives
was eternal? Why won't they realize that it's precisely the
shortness of their lives that gives them their value?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>One can't have everything, little one. We who know—we
have no preferences. And they, who live unpredictable,
unique moments, are ignorant of their value. They envy us
our eternity. Such is the world.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hamadryad: </span>They too will learn something tomorrow. And the
clods of earth and the stones in which they will someday
make their return to the light, will not live solely in hope or
anguish. You'll see. In the new world even the shortest lives
will be in some way blessed.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Satyr: </span>God willing, little one. I'd like that too.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-muses">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Muses</h2>
  <p class="intro">A vast theme. The writer who has glimpsed a single deity
behind the nine Muses of tradition—or Muses and Graces
together, three by three, or only three, or even two—takes
no small risk, as he well knows. But he is convinced
of his vision, as he is of many other things. In the
world of which we write, mothers are often daughters—and
vice versa. The point could be proven. Is proof
necessary? I prefer asking my readers to savor the
fact that, for the Greeks, the festivals of imagination
and memory were almost always celebrated on mountains,
or rather hills, and continually refounded as the
Greeks moved down the peninsula.</p>

  <h3 class="interlocutors">Mnemosyne (Memory), Hesiod</h3>

  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>In short, you aren't happy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>Listen. If I think of some event that has happened, of
seasons already past, it seems to me that I was happy then.
But day by day it's different. I feel a weariness for things
and works that a drunkard feels. Then I stop work and climb
up here on the mountain. But when I think back, it seems
to me again that I've been happy.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>It will always be like that.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>You know all names. What do you call this state of
mind?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>You can give it my name, or your own.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>Melete, my name as a man is nothing. But how should I
invoke you? The name which summons you is different every
time. You are like a mother whose name is lost in the past.
Down in the valley where men live and on the paths from
which one glimpses the mountains, there is much talk of
you. There was a time, they say, when you were to be found
on the most inaccessible mountains, among black trees,
snow, and monsters, in Thrace and Thessaly, and men called
you the Muse. Others call you Calliope or Clio. What is
your real name?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>I come from those places. And I have many names.
I will have still other names when I come down again—Aglaia,
Hegemony, Phaenna, according to the whim of
the place.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>You mean the same weariness I feel drives you from place
to place? You aren't a goddess then?</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Neither weariness, nor goddess, my dear. Today I
like this mountain of Helicon because you're here. I like
being where men are, but a little bit apart. I don't look for
anybody in particular, and I converse with those who know
how to talk.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>But, Melete, I don't know how to talk. And it seems to
me that it's only when I'm with you that I know anything
at all. In your voice and in your names is the past, every
season I remember.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>In Thessaly my name was Mneme.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>Some man once said that you were as old as the tortoise,
tough and decrepit. According to others you're an adolescent
nymph, like a rosebud or a cloud . . .</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>What do <em>you</em> say?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>I don't know. You're Calliope, you're Mneme. Your
voice and your glance are immortal. You're like a hill or
running water—things which are neither young nor old
because for them there is no time. They exist. That's all
we know.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>But you exist too, my dear, and for you existence is
weariness and unhappiness. How do you imagine the life
we immortals live?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>I don't imagine it, Melete. I worship it as I can, with a
pure heart.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Go on, I like your words.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>That's all there is to say.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>I know you mortals. You never tell the whole story.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>When we come face to face with gods, all we can do is
adore.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Forget the gods. I existed before there were gods.
You can talk to me. Men tell me everything. Adore us if
you must, but tell me what you think my life is like.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>How should I know? No goddess ever thought me
worthy of her bed.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Fool, the world has its seasons too, and that season
is over.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>All I know is the land I work.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>You're proud, shepherd. You have that mortal pride.
But it will be your fate to know other things. Tell me why
you feel happy when you talk to me.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>I can answer you that. Because there's a candor, a freshness,
in the things you say which is missing in daily life.
The names you give to things make them different, strange,
and yet as familiar and sweet as a voice for a long time
silent. Or as when you suddenly see yourself mirrored in
the water, and cry out, "Who is this man?"</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>My dear, has it ever happened to you that when
you saw a plant, a stone, a gesture, you experienced the same
thing?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>Yes, it has.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>And did you discover why?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>It was only an instant, Melete. How could I grasp it?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Have you ever asked yourself why an instant can
suddenly make you happy, happy as a god? You are looking,
say, at the olive tree, the olive tree on the path you have
taken every day for years, and suddenly there comes a day
when the sense of staleness leaves you, and you caress the
gnarled trunk with a look, as though you had recognized an
old friend, and it spoke to you precisely the one word your
heart was hoping for. At times it's the glance of a man passing
in the street. Sometimes the rain that drives down for
days on end. Or the hoarse cry of a bird. Or a cloud you
think you've seen somewhere before. For an instant time
stops, and you experience the trivial event as though before
and after had no existence.  Have you ever asked yourself
why this should be?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>It's you who say why. That instant has made the event
a memory, a model.</p>
<p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Can't you conceive of an existence entirely composed
of these instants?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>I can conceive of it.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Then you know what my life is like.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>I believe you, Melete, because your eyes confirm it. And
the fact that many men call you Euterpe no longer surprises
me. But these mortal instants are not a life. If I
wanted to repeat them, they would lose their freshness. The
staleness always comes back.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>But you said that instant was a memory. And what
else is memory but an experience repeated in its intensity?
Do you understand me?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>No. What do you mean?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>I mean that you know what immortal life is like.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>When I talk with you, it's hard for me not to believe.
You saw things as they were in the beginning. You are the
olive tree, the glance, the cloud. You speak of a name, and the
thing exists forever.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Hesiod, I find you up here every day. Before you I
found others in the mountains to the north, by the barren
torrents of Thrace and Pieria. I like you more than the
others. You know that immortal things are close at hand.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>It's not hard to know that. What's hard is touching
them.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>You have to live for them, Hesiod. That means
purity of the heart.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>When I listen to you, yes. But a man's life is down there
in the valley, in the fields, at home. Beside a hearth and in
a bed. And every day that dawns confronts you with the
same toils, the same failures. In the end it wears a man
down, Melete. A sudden storm can refresh the fields—it
isn't death and the great sorrows that make a man lose heart.
But the everlasting, grinding toil, the effort to stay alive
from day to day, the recognition of evil in others, petty evil,
as tiresome as summer flies—that's the life that cripples a
man, Melete.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>I come from places far bleaker still, from foggy inhuman
ravines, where nonetheless life took root. Among
these olives and beneath this sky, you do not know that
fate. Have you ever heard of the swamp of Boibeïs?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>No.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>A dank swamp of slime and reeds, exactly as it was
at the beginning of time, a seething, bubbling silence. It
spawned monsters of excrement and blood. Even today the
Thessalians seldom speak of it. Neither time nor the seasons
change it. No voice reaches there.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>But meanwhile you speak of it, Melete, and you have
hallowed its fate. Your voice has reached it. Now it is a
terrible and a sacred place. The olives and the sky of Helicon
are not the whole of life.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Neither is the staleness or the toil, nor returning to
the daily round. Don't you understand that man, every
man, is born in that swamp of blood? That the sacred and
the divine are with you too? In bed, in the fields, before the
fire? In everything you do, you renew a divine model. Day
and night, there is not an instant, not even the most futile,
which has not sprung from the silence of your origins.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>You speak, Melete, and I cannot help believing. Only
let me adore you.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>My dear, you have an alternative.</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Hesiod: </span>What is that?</p>
  <p class="saying"><span class="interlocutor">Mnemosyne: </span>Try telling mortals the things you know.</p></section>

<section id="dialogue-the-gods">  <h2 class="dialogue-title">The Gods</h2>

  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— The mountain is wild, friend. On the rusty grass of last winter
there are still patches of snow. It looks like the centaur's
robe. These high places are all like this. A few tiny changes,
and the countryside becomes exactly what it was when these
things happened.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— I wonder if they really saw them.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— Who can say? But surely they did see them. They told their
names, and that was all. There lies the whole difference between
stories and the truth. "It was this man, or that man."
"He did this, he said that." The man who tells the truth is
satisfied with that. He doesn't even suspect that his listeners
might not believe him. We are the liars. We have never seen
these things, and yet we know exactly what robe the centaur
wore or the color of the grapes on the threshing-floor of
Icarius.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— All it takes is a hill, a peak, a shore. Any lonely place where
your eyes lift up and stop at the sky. The incredible relief of
things outlined in the air still seizes the heart. For my part I
believe that a tree, a rock, profiled against the sky, were gods
from the very beginning.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— There was a time when even those things didn't exist up
here.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— Agreed. Before them there were the voices of the earth—the
roots, the springs, the snakes. If the daemon links earth with
heaven, he must emerge into the light from the darkness of
the ground.</p>
<p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— I don't know. Those people knew too many things. With a
simple name they told the story of the cloud, the forest, the
fates. They saw with certainty what we barely know. They
had neither the time nor the taste for losing themselves in
dreams. They saw terrible, incredible things, and weren't even
surprised. They knew what it was. If what they said was false,
who could blame them? In those days even you couldn't have
said "It's morning" or "it looks like rain" without losing
your head.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— Yes, they spoke names. So much so that at times I wonder
whether the things or those names came first.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— Believe me, they came together. And it happened here, in
these wild and lonely places. Is there anything surprising in
their coming here? What else could those people have looked
for in a place like this, if not an encounter with the gods?</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— Who can say why they stopped here? But in every abandoned
place, an emptiness, an expectation remains.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— It's the only thing a man could think of, here. These places
have names forever. All that remains is the grass and the sky,
and yet the breath of the wind is more fragrant to the memory
than a storm in a forest. There is neither emptiness nor
expectation. What has been exists forever.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— But those people are dead and buried. These places now are
what they were before there were men. I am willing to grant
you that what they said was true. But what else remains?
You'll admit that we no longer have encounters with gods on
the mountain paths. When I say, "It's morning" or "It looks
like rain," I'm not talking about gods.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— We talked about the gods tonight. Yesterday you were talking
about summer, and the desire you feel when you breathe the
warm evening air. At other times you talk about man, about
people you have known, of your past tastes, of unexpected
encounters. All things that once existed. I can assure you that
I listened to you as I listen once again to those ancient names
within me. When you tell me the things you know, I don't
ask you, "But what else remains?" or whether the word or
the things came first. I live with you, and I feel myself alive.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— It isn't easy to live as though what happened in another age
were real. Yesterday when the fog overtook us in lonely country,
and a couple of stones tumbled down from the hill to our
feet, we didn't think of divine things or a fantastic encounter,
but only of the night and the hares we had startled. Who we
are and what we believe emerge when we are confronted with
hardship, in the hour of risk.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— When we are home again it will be pleasant to talk with our
friends about last night and the hares we startled. But our
fear is something to smile at if we think of the terror of those
people to whom everything that happened was mortal, fatal.
People for whom the air was crowded with nocturnal terrors,
mysterious threats, dreadful memories. Think, for instance, of
storms or earthquakes. And if their uneasiness was real—as it
certainly was—then the hope, the courage, the joyous discovery
of powers, of promises, of encounters, were also real. For
my part, I never tire of hearing them tell of the terrors in the
night and the things in which they set their hopes.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— And you believe in the monsters? In the tales of men turned
into beasts, in the breathing rocks, in the divine smiles, and
the words that annihilated?</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— I believe in what every man has hoped for and suffered. If
they in their time climbed up to these rock-strewn heights, or
scoured the world for fatal swamps, it was because they found
in those places something of which we are ignorant. Not
bread, not pleasure. Not precious health. Men know where
those things are found. Not here. As for us who live far
away, down by the shore or in the fields, we have lost that
other thing.</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— That other thing? What do you mean?</p>
  <p class="final-dialogue-interlocutor">— You know. Those encounters of theirs.</p></section>
